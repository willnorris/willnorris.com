Elisabeth and I are officially booked to come out east in August.  Most of our time will be in North Carolina spending
time with my mom and brother and his family, but we'll be in Memphis from around August 19th through the 22nd and should
be at Lifelink that Sunday (Aug 20th).  Anybody that'll be in town that weekend, make sure you come to church and say
hi.
