    "html": "The wpopenid install on blogs.gnome.org is not problem free though.  I don't think the problems are WPMu related though.\r\n\r\nTrying to use the OpenID Provider portion of wpopenid fails for many relying parties due to a bad interaction with the Bad Behaviour plugin.  If an RP initiates the authentication process through a form post rather than a redirect, BB blocks the request because it is an off site form post.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine a similar problem could occur in wpopenid's RP half if the remote OP sent its response as a form post.\r\n\r\nI've got no idea if this is something that can be addressed in wpopenid, or if it needs to be fixed in Bad Behaviour.",
