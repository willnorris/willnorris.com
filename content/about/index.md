Hi, I'm Will Norris.
I'm a follower of Jesus, a husband to [Elisabeth], a father to [Gabriel] and [Judah],
a citizen of the [indie web], and a software engineer at [Tailscale].

Prior to Tailscale, I was the Open Source Lead at Twitter.
Before that, I was at Google [for 10 years], with most of that time spent in
their [Open Source Programs Office] leading the engineering and license compliance groups.
I had previously helped design and build the [Google+ API],
having spent much of my career working on developing tools and technologies for the social web like
[OpenID], [OAuth], [XRD], and [Activity Streams].
I also spent a number of years in the enterprise identity management space
working on [Shibboleth] and LDAP directories at [USC].

Almost all of my personal projects these days are [indie web] related, mostly [written in go].
I'm also a huge fan of [WordPress] and their mission to democratize publishing.
Even though I no longer use WordPress for this site, I still manage other WordPress-powered site,
and continue to maintain a number of [plugins] and occasionally contribute to WordPress core and WordPress for Android.

## Contact

I can be contacted by email at will @ this domain or by phone at +1 (901) 484-9455.

I'm not interested in hearing about job opportunities.

Most images are proxied through my [imageproxy] server to handle simple things like dynamic resizing.
