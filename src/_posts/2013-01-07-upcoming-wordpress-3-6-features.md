Mark Jaquith [talking about WordPress 3.6][], which will be focused on the post authoring experience:

> I want people to trust WordPress with their posts. They should never fear that something they’ve spent time creating
> or editing should go away due to their mistake or ours or that of a third party. Mistakes and errors should be
> recoverable. I can’t stress enough how important it is that people believe this and have good reason to believe it. If
> a post gets lost, there is a catastrophic loss of trust, that could take years to be regained (if indeed it ever is).
> This is people’s time and their creative output we’re talking about. If we’re not valuing those things above all else,
> then our priorities are seriously out of order. This is an all-hands-on-deck item for 3.6.

I'm not sure if I just haven't been paying close enough attention in the past, but the last couple of WordPress releases
have been marked by a very clear product focus and zeal that is impressive, even by WordPress standards.
