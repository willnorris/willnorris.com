    "html": "<p>You're absolutely right on a number of points.  If the communication identifier - the email - isn't verified, the  generated MicroID is just another piece of cruft.  Verify the email and things get interesting (granted - maybe more trouble than anyone wants to go to on a comment - but if you can comment with OpenID, you're absolutely right - things got a lot more interesting).</p>\n\n<p>As to the end of your second points, right now the verifier's are very rudimentary.  I believe as this matures, verifiers will interpret the DOM and be able to tell exactly what content on a page is \"claimed\" by a certain MicroID.  That gets pretty exciting.</p>\n\n<p>I really keep thinking back to the very logical tie-ins between openID commenting and MicroID...very very powerful stuff!</p>\n\n<p>Great post.</p>\n",
