    "html": "Stephen: in most cases, that will work fine, but various vendors do different things with the .local TLD.  So you may get unexpected results depending on how you have your hosts file setup, or even the network you happen to be on at the time.  Like I said, you'll probably be fine, but if you really want to play it safe, don't use .local.  I typically just drop the TLD altogether for most sites.",
