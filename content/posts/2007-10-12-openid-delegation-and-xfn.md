I contacted the [FreeYourID][] folks earlier this week to ask them about adding an XFN link to my forwarding page at
[will.norris.name][].  They seemed receptive to the idea and should hopefully be adding that soon.  I was then telling
[Chris Messina][] about it and I think he misunderstood me, but in the process got me thinking.  You see, FreeYourID
does delegate OpenIDs off to [MyOpenID][], but the `openid.delegate` is the same as your FreeYourID URL.  In addition to
this, they have a meta refresh tag to forward web traffic to a site of your choosing ([claimID][] in my case).  I was
asking for a `rel="me"` link for this forwarded URL be added.

But what about OpenID delegate URLs?  Is there ever a case when it does **not** make sense to add `rel="me"` to an
OpenID delegate?  I can't imagine that there is, since the very act of delegating is saying "this is my ID over at this
other service".  With that in mind, I propose that openid delegates always include `rel="me"` in addition to
`rel="openid.delegate"`.  Rel is a space delimited multi-valued attribute, and I've successfully tested a couple of
different services.  Here's a concrete example of my OpenID delegation links here on willnorris.com...

    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://www.myopenid.com/server" />
    <link rel="openid.delegate me" href="http://will.norris.name/" />

I will be updating my [yadis plugin][] to behave in this manner as well.
