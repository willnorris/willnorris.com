That's the way everything works at my employer, with the addition of an LDAP directory which applications can use to authenticate users, although the directory in turns goes to Kerberos.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the type of setup a company like TxD must have, I can somewhat understand the need for not doing this, especially since that password is shared among so many systems (not that I necessarily agree with that either).",
