**Update 2023:** I now use the Caddy instead of nginx,
and have an [equivalent Caddy snippet here](/2023/caddy-snippets/).

In my ever-continuing attempt to [indiewebify][] my [new static website][], I wanted to share what I came up with for
receiving webmentions. Being a static site, I have to use some kind of webmention sidecar to process and store the
mentions themselves. I'm currently using [Pelle Wessman][]'s [webmention service][] on Heroku, which works pretty well.
But I was also interested in having a "[visible endpoint that teaches][]", as well as one that had a web form for
manually submitting webmentions. And of course, I like the idea of hosting it on my own site, so I can customize it
exactly how I want.

What I ended up with is a hybrid approach. My new webmention endpoint is
[https://willnorris.com/api/webmention](/api/webmention). All HTTP `GET` requests to that URL are served by a static
file on my webserver, while HTTP `POST` requests are forwarded to Pelle's webmention service using nginx's proxy module.
I feel like this gives me the best of both worlds, and the configuration to do it was surprisingly simple:

```nginx
location = /api/webmention {
  if ($request_method = POST) {
    proxy_pass https://webmention.herokuapp.com;
  }
  try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
}
```

I did luck out in that Pelle chose `/api/webmention` as the path for his webmention endpoint. This is exactly what I was
wanting to use, which means the proxy just works. Had I wanted to map a different path, it would have been a little more
complicated because nginx has some limits on how proxies can be configured inside `if` blocks ([this stackoverflow
post][] has some details).

**Still to do:** <s>Currently, when you submit the form on my webmention page it just returns a plaintext success
message, since that's what the webmention service returns. I need to add a little javascript to the form so that it is
submitted in an XHR request and a nicer success message can be displayed.</s> (fixed)

I'm also still not displaying received webmentions, but I'll get to that eventually.
