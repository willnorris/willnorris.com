    "html": "Wow, I must say I am a bit overwhelmed by the number of well thought-out and useful comments.  Apparently there were a couple that still thought I was making a moral argument or that I was advocating discrimination or something.  Nevertheless, thanks to everyone else.  \r\n\r\nIt seems that I was making a pretty basic (and incorrect) assumption... that it is the civil rights advocates who would be the only ones interested in removing \"marriage\" from the law.  Somehow it didn't occur to me that the religious right would be just as interested in doing so if they felt the marriage pool was being \"polluted\" (Thanks Mark, for that awesome analogy).  I would still love to hear any additional comments other people have, as this has been extremely thought provoking.",
