    "html": "Hey man... I came across your blog from a comment you left on XXXChurch.com. I spent a year in LA last year and will be returning in August to finish school at Biola University. I don't know if you belong to a church community yet, but you should definitely visit Mosaic.\r\n\r\nMosaic gathers two times on Sunday nights in Downtown, LA (kind of out by USC which is where you live, I think) at the Mayan Nightclub. It's on 10th and Olympic if I remember correctly. Mosaic gathers at 5 and 7 still, I believe.\r\n\r\nCheck them out online:\r\n\r\nMosaic.org\r\n\r\nAnd the Pastor on his website:\r\n\r\nwww.erwinmcmanus.com\r\n\r\nTake care, man!\r\n\r\n\r\ncb",
