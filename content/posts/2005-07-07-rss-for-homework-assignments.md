Had an idea hit me while browsing through the iTunes podcasts... RSS enclosures are not limited to just audio files, you
can attach literally any file you want to an RSS feed.  I'm really excited to see more developers use Frasier Speirs'
[Appcasting][] idea.  I got to thinking how cool it'd be to use an RSS feed (with or without enclosures) to distribute
school assignments.  Each course could have it's own feed and the students simply subscribe to the courses they're
enrolled in.  You could easily attach files necessary for the assignment such as worksheets, audio files for music
classes, etc.  Granted, it'd be just as easy to hand out a syllabus at the beginning of the semester and make all the
resources available on a website somewhere, but I just like the idea of all the assignments of all of my classes waiting
for me in my RSS reader.
