I really love these two quotes from Lillian Karabaic's great piece, <cite><a
href="http://anomalily.net/the-indie-web-is-the-new-zines/">The Indie Web is the new
Zines</a></cite>. They really underscore the importance of the indie web (and ideas like it) to
ensuring free speech and diverse opinions:

> One of the most important parts of recognizing diverse perspectives is insuring that individuals
> are heard in the way that they choose. When there is an intermediary between those creating media
> and the consumption of said media, there is a potential for that narrative to be suppressed.

> I think that fighting Facebook is the wrong approach. I see this not as a Facebook-specific issue
> but a key failing of the corporate social media model: as long as we’re subjected to the TOS of a
> corporation, as long as all the writing, photos, and identity that we create online is filtered
> through someone else’s channels, there’s always the potential for censorship or worse.
