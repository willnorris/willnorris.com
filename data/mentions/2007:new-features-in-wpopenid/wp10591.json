    "html": "(trying out to see if I get OpenId working here...)\r\n\r\nI've installed revision 11698 of wpopenid+ and am running the latest WP2.2.1 version. I can get the blog address accepted with Livejournal, but when LJ tries to take me back to the blog, I keep getting the main login screen. This happens in any of the fields where I can use OpenID (login screen, register screen, default sidebar, comment form). I feel like I'm thisclose to getting it to work so it's a bit frustrating... Am I missing something, or is it just an incompatibility with 2.2.1?",
