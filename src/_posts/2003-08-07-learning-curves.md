in one of the mailing lists i'm on, someone noted the difficulty in learning to use a particular program by saying how
it had a "steep learning curve". well another user corrected him explaining how a "steep" learning curve actually refers
to something is easy to learn, not difficult.  He also provided [this article][] for more information... a very
interesting read to say the least.

And of course I'm the kind of person that will use the correct meaning of the phrase regardless of (and perhaps in spite
of) the mainstream confusion... this should make for interesting conversations.
