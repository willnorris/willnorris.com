My thinking on the matter:\r\n\r\n - it's a valid http request, so Bad Behavior should allow it, regardless\r\n - I don't **want** to ship a modified version of the JanRain library if I can at all keep from it\r\n - I **will** ship a modified version of the library if we need to, but I want some more information before doing so",
