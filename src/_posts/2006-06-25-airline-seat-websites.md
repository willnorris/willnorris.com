So I just discovered a new class of websites this morning... I was going over the itinerary for my trip to Vermont that
leaves in about 4 hours, and I noticed I hadn't picked my seat for one of the return flights.  I pulled up the website
to choose my seat assignment, but was unable to determine which rows were the exit rows (since these tend to have more
leg room).  I googled for [delta boeing 767 exit rows][] and was amazed at how many websites there are that provide
layouts of aircrafts and the pros and cons of each seating section.  I can't say that it really surprises me, but I sure
wish I would have known this for the last couple of trips I took.

A few of those sites:
