After 10 years, 8 months, and a handful of days, today is my last day at Google.
It's surreal and bittersweet, but I'm really excited about what's next. As I'm
writing this, I'm sitting outside of Charlie's, getting ready to go gather my
personal belongings and turn in my badge to security.

I joined Google a lot younger, not yet married two years, and before we had our
two boys (who just started preschool and Kindergarten!). I spent my first
couple of years working on Google Buzz and then Google+, then starting a 20%
project managing Google's open source releases on GitHub. That turned out to
require a lot more than just 20% time, so now eight years later in Google's
[Open Source Programs Office][], I'm leaving behind an amazing organization I'm
so honored to have gotten to be a part of. And I'm so grateful to [Chris
DiBona][] for taking a bet on a no-name engineer, and giving me so many
opportunities to help get me to where I am today.

I'll be sticking around in open source, and will be starting the next adventure
in a couple of weeks. For now, I'm enjoying my final walk around a very empty
Googleplex, recalling some great memories, and trying to fully take in how
amazing this ride has been. I will miss this place and the phenomenal people I
got to work with.
