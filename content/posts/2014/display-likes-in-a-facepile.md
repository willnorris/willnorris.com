This weekend I got webmentions working on my site again, and now thanks to [brid.gy](http://brid.gy) I have Twitter
likes, Google +1s, etc feeding back into my site.  By default though, they display as normal WordPress comments.
Tonight, I got them displaying as a facepile.  For example, see the bottom of my [IndieWebCamp 2014
post](/2014/03/indiewebcamp-2014).

There's still more I'd like to do with the UI, and the code needs to be cleaned up quite a bit so I can start sending it
upstream, but if anyone wants to take a look, here's the [interesting commit][]
