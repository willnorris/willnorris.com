Getting error \"Could not discover an OpenID identity server endpoint at the url: http://michaelgracie.com\" and have found Blogger and a couple of other Wordpress sites can't verify it either.  XRDS-Simple is in place, the links show in source, and /author/... point to the server.</p>\n\n<p>I can't be sure whether this started sometime during an OpenID upgrade, when I moved to 2.9, or when I started using WP-Super Cache, but those are the only changes that have happened.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n<p>Michael</p>\n",
