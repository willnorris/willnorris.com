So I just checked in to [Hotel Lucia][lucia] for OSCON, and the guy at the front desk asked if I had ever stayed here
before.  Well I have in fact, just a few weeks ago for Open Source Bridge, and I commented that I was surprised that
this didn't simply pop up on his screen.  It turns out that while the giant hotel chains like Marriott and Hilton have
really fancy check-in systems, everyone else is stuck with a system that he described as "just a step above DOS".  So if
you are looking for a startup idea (especially here in Portland), here you go... hotel management software.  There have
been a few recent restaurant related startups, but nothing for hotels that I've seen.
