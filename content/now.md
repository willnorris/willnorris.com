## Personal

After 13 years living in and around Half Moon Bay, CA, we moved to Temecula, CA in 2023.
Elisabeth's family lives in the area, and we had a very limited support network there.
Plus it's easy for me to work remote, and escaping the Bay Area cost of living was nice.
The local politics are kinda awful, but the schools are highly rated,
and we found [a church](https://northcoastchurch.com) we really like.

We bought a house we like in a really great neighborhood,
and have been keeping ourselves busy with remodel projects and
trying not to kill the 150 rose bushes or dozen fruit trees on the property.

## Professional

I've been working as a software engineer at Tailscale since May 2022.
I've worked on a bunch of different things, but am currently focused on identity-related projects.
