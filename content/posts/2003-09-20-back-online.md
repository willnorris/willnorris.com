so you may have noticed that this site has been offline for the past week and a half. I also haven't been online much at
all, and my email has pretty much gone to hell. The problem is that I host all of this (website, mail, etc) at home and
bellsouth kindly shut off our DSL last week. It's been a serious pain getting it all back up, but I think we're back to
some form of stability. In the meantime, I'll be looking for some sort of backup system in case this ever happens again.
Oh, and my cell phone is off too right now. will get that back on this next week when i get paid. ... this is all so
frustrating.
