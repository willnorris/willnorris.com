As soon as I tried to activate it, I got \"Fatal error: Call to undefined function: set_include_path() in /home/sites/site4/users/duke-wie/web/blog/wp-content/plugins/wpopenid/openid-registration.php on line 919\"\r\n\r\nLooking at the blog, it had the OpenID logo by the login area, but when I tried to enter one, it crashed with the same error.\r\n\r\nI've got WordPress 2.0.10. I've fogotten what the php version is, but I know that it's the one that's not quite enough to allow us to use WP 2.1 (? php v 3???)",
