I get this error message on my test system:\r\n\r\nCould not discover an OpenID identity server endpoint at the url: docwhat.gerf.org\r\n\r\nWhen I updated to 2.20 most of my patches to OpenID fell out.  I assume this is a good thing.  If you recall, I had patches to fix the web page parsing.\r\n\r\nThe old findHTML() function seems to be gone, so I assume that they aren't needed anymore?\r\n\r\nI can see that it does (two?) fetches of docwhat.gerf.org. But I don't seem to be able to figure out where in the parsing it fails. :-(\r\n\r\nOthers seem to be having trouble too:\r\nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/191523",
