    "html": "Well, it's been an interesting year, to say the least! Worse things certainly could have happened, and I think if all this results in you moving up to Portland to work on bigger and better things, net-net, I'd say we still are ending up ahead of the game.\r\n\r\nI expect things to only get more interested in the DiSo Project (in one form or another), so I hope that I can still expect your contributions in one form or another to the open, social stack!\r\n\r\nAnd, I imagine I'll be visiting you guys before long as well. The draw of Portland is only getting stronger.",
