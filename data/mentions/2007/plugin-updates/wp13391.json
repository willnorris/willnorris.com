I haven't been able to replicate the error anywhere else, so I haven't been able to really debug it.  My best suggestion would be to remove all traces of the plugin (drop the tables, delete the plugin itself, delete all options named oid_*) and then start fresh.  I also seem to remember that when I had that problem with UTW, it seemed to be exacerbated by certain themes.</p>\n",
