Is there anything I should do?</blockquote>\r\nHmm, I'd say go look at the logs but now that I think about it, I don't think I added to much useful stuff there :)  I'd try this... make sure you have the latest version (I just checked in revision 30 last night), make sure you have \"create local accounts\" turned on for now (you can try it turned off afterward), and delete all the cookies you have for the domain.  Then try logging in by entering only a website, leaving name and email empty.  If that works, turn \"create local accounts\" off, delete all cookies, and try again.\r\n\r\nI'll see about adding some more useful debugging statements to track things as they're happening.",
