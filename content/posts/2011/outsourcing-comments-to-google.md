A few weeks ago I quietly (or [not][] [so][] [quietly][], as it were) disabled comments on my blog. It was something
I'd been considering for a while, and I finally resolved to do it after talking with [Shane Becker][] at
[IndieWebCamp][] back in June. Shane takes the stance that his site should be about him and his content. If you want
to comment or respond, you're welcome to do so... just find your own place to publish it (like your own blog, perhaps).

I'm not interested in building a community or a personal brand, so I really don't care about capturing engagement here
on my site. I do value a lot of the comments I get however, so I'm not looking to cut things off entirely. Instead,
I've decided to outsource my comments to Google+.

Today [we announced][] the launch of the Google+ API, starting with read access to public data. Using the new API
together with the [+1 button][], I've added support to my [snowflake][] to share my posts to Google+, and then to easily
direct conversations from my blog to there. It allows me to keep my own home on the web dedicated to just my content,
and at the same time leverage the great community that has formed around Google+.

Please [try it out][snowflake] yourself, and let me know how it works for you. This was the work of a single evening,
so I'm sure I'll enhance it over time. Please [file any bugs][] or feature requests you have.
