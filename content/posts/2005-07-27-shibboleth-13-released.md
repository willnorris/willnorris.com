Just before going home on monday, Walter and I made the final release of [Shibboleth][] 1.3.  Okay, so he did a few
things in CVS and I just kinda watched, but it was fun all the same.  My last six months here at [UofM][] have been
focused on this release.  I started off with some pretty cool unit test scripts, which led to the development of a nice
little embedded Tomcat class that can test pretty much an servlet.  We squashed a couple of bugs due to my tests, but
the test code didn't end up going into this release.  Most recently I developed new installation method that ended up
leading to some really cool methods for installing Shib plugins.  Again, this led to some pretty nice [ant][]
[tasks][build.xml] to create interactive input menus.  I've thought about cleaning them up a little and submitting them
to [ant-contrib][], but haven't had the time or overwhelming desire yet.

Okay, so I didn't completely rewrite the [IdP ProtocolHandler][] or anything near as significant, but it's been a lot of
fun working on a large distributed project, as opposed to the in-house work I normally do.  Plus it's kinda neat knowing
that hundreds (thousands?) of people will be using my script to install Shibboleth. :-)  Hopefully with focus now
shifting toward version 2.0, I'll be able to get my hands dirty in the program code a little more.
