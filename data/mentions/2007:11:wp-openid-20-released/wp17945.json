    "html": "<p>Thanks for the answer Will, but unfortunately it does not work for me. The plugin mentions that it works with Kubrick or Sandbox themes but mine is based on Hemingway :-/</p>\n\n<p>Generally when I added the plugin, nothing seemed to happen to the template. When I changed the name of the website field to \"openid_url\" then it always asks for authentication and fails if it is missing. If I keep the field as \"url\" then it never asks for authentication.</p>\n\n<p>I've made <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/159062?replies=1#post-700242\">a thread of the WP forums</a> if that is easier for you</p>\n",
