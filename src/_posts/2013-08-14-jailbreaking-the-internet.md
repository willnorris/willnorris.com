I'm really happy to see that [Klint Finley][]'s Wired article about [IndieWebCamp][], titled [Meet the Hackers Who Want
to Jailbreak the Internet][wired article], is now up.  It's a great piece, you should definitely go read it.  I've
certainly never heard this described as "jailbreaking the Internet", but I guess I can go with that. :)

I think Klint did a great job capturing the heart of what we're trying to do with the indie web, and how it differs from
previous efforts we've all either witnessed or been a part of.  Our current focus is on a much smaller scale this time
around, both in terms of target audience (participants are encouraged to focus just on building something that works for
them personally), and in terms of the types of solutions we're trying build.

>  your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere."

I spent my first three years at Google helping to build Google+.  I love so many things about what we built, and it's
the primary way that I stay in touch with many of my colleagues, so I'm not trying to replace it or eschew it by any
means.  But I also think it's incredibly important to maintain control of my primary identity online, and that's what
the indie web is all about.

## Blogs of August ##

I also love that Klint's article was published right in the middle of [Mike Elgan][]'s "Blogs of August" where he is
trying to convince bloggers to give up their personal sites and [blog exclusively on Google+ for the month of
August][blogs-of-august].  Needless to say, I think this is a terrible idea, especially for people who have already made
the effort to set up their own site.  I also find it terribly ironic and hypocritical that Mike doesn't actually blog
exclusively on Google+ himself, as he talks about in the [comments of this
post](https://plus.google.com/114506455000417633669/posts/YwyYmT5VSSG):

> I write opinion columns that appear on Computerworld, Datamation, Cult of Mac, Cult of Android, Houzz and Forbes
> NetAppVoice...
>
> ... I also blog on +The Spartan Diet here on Google+, but also on <http://spartandiet.org> -- which is the web site we
> are building to promote our upcoming book.
>
> So, no, I don't blog exclusively on Google+...

To be fair, Mike personally makes a distinction between what a blog is, separate from the content management tool used
to write.  However, I don't entirely follow his rationale, and I would suspect that many people that are choosing to
participate in "Blogs of August" don't make the distinction either.  At best it's disingenuous, at worst it's
hypocritical and harmful to others.

If nothing else though, the willingness of people to abandon their personal blogs to write exclusively for a silo
demonstrates that the indie web has a long way to go, both in terms of education as well as tooling.  As Klint says in
the closing of his Wired piece, "the movement is unfinished."
