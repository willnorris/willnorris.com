I didn't know I had an hour and a half worth of videos on there, but I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is a really fun job :)</p></blockquote>\n<p>okay, so maybe some of that time was watching David Belle, but I did have to watch the K-SWISS one a few times.  I love the fact that you used a Magnatunes artist in one of the videos as well... nice!</p>\n\n<p>(hrm... guess I should try and stay on topic on my own blog?  back to openid.)</p>\n",
