    "html": "I do agree with you when you say no sin is greater or less than the other. I'm conflicted as to Proposition 8, mainly because it's too complex for as it stands now. By supporting it does it mean I'm judging, a sin and arrogance by itself, homosexuality? On the other hand, does my opposition mean I condone gay marriage? Either way, I don't think I'm in a position to choose one over another, without being judgmental. So, it's complicated for me.",
