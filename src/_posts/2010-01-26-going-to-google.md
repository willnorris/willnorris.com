I'm happy to announce today that I've accepted a job at Google, working on the newly formed Social Web team.  I will be
joining fellow new-hires [Joseph Smarr][] and [Chris Messina][], as well as a host of other incredibly talented
engineers, in contributing to the emerging standards and growing developer community in this space.

Instead of the long contemplative post on how this move is the next logical step in a career of working in Identity
Management, I'll keep it short.  I start work next Monday, February 1st, and I'm a bit pre-occupied this week with
getting moved from Portland, Oregon down to Half Moon Bay, California.

I expect great things from our team in 2010, and so should you.
