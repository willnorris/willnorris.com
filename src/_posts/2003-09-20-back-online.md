so you may have noticed that this site has been offline for the past week and
a half. I also haven't been online much at all, and my email has pretty much
gone to hell. The problem is that I host all of this (website, mail, etc) at
home and bellsouth kindly shut off our DSL last week. It's been a serious pain
getting it all back up, but I think we're back to some form of stability. In the
meantime, I'll be looking for some sort of backup system in case this ever
happens again. Oh, and my cell phone is off too right now. will get that back on
this next week when i get paid. ... this is all so frustrating.
