[Drew McLellan on self publishing](http://allinthehead.com/retro/365/ideas-of-march-2013):

> If content is important to you, keep it close. If your content is important to others, keep it close and well backed up. Hope that what you’ve created never has to die. Make sure that if something has to die, it’s you that makes that decision. Own your own data, friends, and keep it safe.
