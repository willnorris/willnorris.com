## Unstable Repo Warning ##

I tend to overwrite commits, perform force pushes, and may occasionally rewrite
the entire history of the repository. I'm happy if some of this proves useful
to someone, just don't rely on commits here being stable.

variety of sources with different licensing restrictions.  I've attempted to
