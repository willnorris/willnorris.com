During his [WWDC Keynote][], Steve Jobs demoed the podcasting capabilities of the upcoming version of iTunes and
displayed a "New Music Tuesdays" podcast setup by Apple.  What made this one particularly interesting is that album
artwork changed _during_ the podcast to display the currently playing track.  They've apparently extended their album
art metadata to support multiple images that each span a very specific portion of the file.  It's certainly a very
interesting case of what can potentially be done.

However, I'm not so sure that embedding a Keynote presentation into an audio file is the best idea -- it definitely
seems to be taking the wrong approach.  Podcasting aside, an excellent language called [SMIL][] exists to create
multimedia presentations consisting of multiple types of embedded media files, and since [Quicktime already plays
nice][quicktime+smil] it would seem that iTunes could play the files without much work.  One could certainly enclose a
SMIL file into an RSS feed, but I don't know if it would integrate as easily as existing podcasts; it would certainly be
interesting to find out.
