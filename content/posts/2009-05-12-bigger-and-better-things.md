I'm not sure what it is with us... you'd think we would have learned our lesson the first time.  Almost exactly a year
ago, Elisabeth and I did something I would never recommend to anyone.  We made three major life changes in the course of
a month or so -- we got married, I took a new job, and we moved to a new city.  Individually, none of those are too bad,
but all at once they make for a lot of unnecessary stress.  Well it looks like we're at it again (except for the married
part)...

## Moving to Portland ##

Neither Elisabeth nor I have fully adjusted to the way of life in San Francisco (we currently live in SoMa, right next
to downtown).  I'm sure we could find something quieter in other parts of the bay area, but for us it's still not the
same.  I've found that I click much better with the Portland Tech scene personality-wise, and it's really hard to beat
the beautiful scenery of the Pacific northwest, so we'll be moving to Portland at the end of next month.  We have many
new and old friends in the Portland area, and are terribly excited to reconnect with a [few in particular][] and get
grounded in a good church home.  While I fully expect for my work to remain relatively fast paced, we're just looking to
slow down some of the other aspects of our life.


## New Work ##

I am also in the process of looking for new work, starting immediately.  As you can read in the [official
announcement][], Vidoop was forced to layoff a considerable portion of the staff, myself included.  Times are tough
right now, and they're doing what they need to do in order for the company to weather this current economic storm.
Vidoop really was a dream job for me, in every sense of the term, and I will miss working alongside a bunch of really
talented developers.  Hopefully our move to Portland will mean I'll have the chance to work with some of them again in
the future.

At this point, I'm not entirely sure where I'll end up after this.  Ideally, I'd like to stay in the identity space,
continuing to work on technologies like SAML, OpenID, OAuth, XRD, etc.  That's where both my interest and experience
lie, and where I'd be most effective... I still have a lot I'd like to offer to that space.  I do have a couple of
opportunities I'm pursuing right now, but I'm also curious to see what else might be out there.  I've posted an [updated
resume][] in case any one out there has my next dream job waiting for me, either on a full-time or contract basis.

And if you've got opportunities for some other awesome Portland-based developers, let me know.  I know their expertise
includes PHP, Python, Django, jQuery, C/C++/C#, PostreSQL and probably a bunch of other languages and technologies.
We've setup an internal mailing list so if you've got a position or two open, please let me know and I'll pass them
along.
