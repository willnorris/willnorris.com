## Personal

After 13 years living in and around Half Moon Bay, CA, we moved to Temecula, CA this past summer (2023).
Elisabeth's family lives in the area, and there were just a lot of reasons right now to move.
Quite honestly, we're still adjusting to new schools, new community, new everything.
While there are certainly some aspects that are great, overall it's been a tough transition.

I'm [currently reading](/wiki/reading-list/) _Artificial Condition (Book 2 of The Murderbot Diaries)_ by Martha Wells.

## Professional

I've been working as a software engineer at Tailscale since May 2022.
Right now I'm working on a few different things, mostly the Tailscale [web client] and [API].

[API]: https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/api.md
