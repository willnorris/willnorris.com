This privacy policy explains the information collected by this website,
willnorris.com, a well as associated applications I run for my personal use.

# Information this site collects

I do not run any analytics or tracking on this site.  My web server logs basic
information like IP addresses and timestamps.

# Information collected by associated applications

I run several personal applications that collect and manage my own personal data
on various services. This includes personally identifiable information (about
me) and loads of other private information. This data is retained
indefinitely... that's kind of the whole point.

Many of those services require a privacy policy, so here it is. No one should
ever use any of these applications besides myself.
