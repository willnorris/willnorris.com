Because of scheduling conflicts with the Visible School Winter Entreat, we won't be doing the little send-off party on
Thursday.  Elisabeth and I will be going to the Thursday evening dinner and worship service at Visible School, so we'll
see some of you all there.  For anyone else that just has the overwhelming desire to meet Elisabeth or say goodbye
before I head out, just [give me a call][] or stop by the house sometime.
