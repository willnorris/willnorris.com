    "html": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThanks for working on this.  I had a few problems installing the latest wpopenid from trunk...\r\n\r\nFirst, the plugin is expecting the file Auth/OpenID/SReg.php to be Sreg.php (lower case r). Then wordpress seems to be happy with the plugin.\r\n\r\nHowever, I then receive a database error after I successfully login to my openid provider and get redirected back to my blog.\r\n\r\nWordPress database error: [Unknown column 'server_url' in 'field list']\r\nREPLACE INTO wp_openid_settings (blah blah blah)\r\n\r\nThere is apparently no server_url field in the wp_openid_settings table.  I'm using MySQL 4.1",
