so I've made a new template -- whoopady doo!  Thanks to [David LeBer][] for the initial inspiration and [Todd Klassy][]
for the top image (lecture hall at Bascom Hall at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin).  I tested most
browsers, but if this layout looks like crap in your particular browser I'd love to hear about it (just be sure to let
me know which browser you're using).
