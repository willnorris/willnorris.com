Last week, Elisabeth and I went up to the [Conservatory of Flowers][] in Golden Gate Park.  As we were walking toward
the entrance, I heard some music coming from the tunnel that goes under the street.  I couldn't tell if it was recorded
or live, so ventured over to investigate.  These three guys were on the other side of the locked gates having a little
jazz session that, thanks to the acoustics of the tunnel, projected really well and just sounded incredible.  I almost
could have just stayed and listened to them play, and just skipped the flowers.
