No public Javadocs just yet, but code is available from: <a href=\"https://svn.middleware.georgetown.edu/java-openid/trunk/\">https://svn.middleware.georgetown.edu/java-openid/trunk/</a>.  And the unit tests should give a slightly better idea of how to use the library until I get better documentation written.</p>\n",
