In certain circumstances, it will automatically quote the last comment.  For example, if you log out and view this post, so that the comment form Name and Mail fields are blank, you will see that Quoter automatically fills in the comment field with a quote from the pingback about OpenID and Microformats.</p>\n\n<p>I published a hack fix for this in the <a href=\"http://www.damagedgoods.it/wp-plugins/quoter/#comment-30399\">Quoter Plugin comments</a>.</p>\n",
