## Personal

After 13 years living in and around Half Moon Bay, CA, we have recently moved to Temecula, CA.
Elisabeth's family lives in the area, and there are just a lot of reasons right now to move.
There are also many reasons to stay, so this has been a very difficult process for us.
We just moved at the end of June and are now in the process of getting everything set up.

I haven't been reading as much as I would like.
Still mostly science fiction when I do.
I recently finished _A Memory Called Empire_, and am now on the second book of the series,
[A Desolation Called Peace](https://www.arkadymartine.net/books/adcp).

## Professional

I left Twitter back in May 2022 and joined Tailscale.
After 10 years of working in open source program management,
and over half of that time doing people management, I was ready to be an engineer again.
The change in my happiness and satisfaction in my job has been significant.
