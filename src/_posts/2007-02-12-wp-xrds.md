I started writing this XRDS ([Yadis][]) plugin for wordpress several months ago, but never really finished putting in
the features I had planned.  With [so][] [much][] [going][] [on][] in the OpenID community the past couple of weeks, I
decided to blow the dust off and clean it up a bit.

I have to say though, I've been very frustrated with the direction a lot of implementors seem to be going with their
OpenID deployments.  It seems like everyone wants to be your identity provider... they'll hold all your data and your
password, and you can use them to login to all of the OpenID sites.  Even better, you get to have a spiffy cool username
with their corporate branding all over it like `http://openid.somecompany.com/users/joeuser/`.  Isn't that great?!
\*sigh\* While this is all well and good for a lot of people that need something like that, this completely ignores the
whole *user-centric* identity model this is all based on.  Unless a user is ridiculously devoted to your site and
community, they don't want an ID under your domain.  If you're someone like [Technorati][], then all of your users
likely have their own blog anyway, and thus their own URL to use for OpenID!  It seems that very few of the larger
Identity Providers out in the wild today are really making an effort to advertise the delegation feature of OpenID,
which I think is by far one of its most attractive qualities.  The beauty of delegation is that someone else gets to do
the grunt-work of supporting the infrastructure for actually running the IDP, but your public face is always at your own
domain.  Your identity is still your own... always.  If a provider says mean things about your cat or won't respond to
your constant MySpace friend requests, it takes about 10 seconds to jump ship and move somewhere else.  This also helps
to ensure constant competition between providers to develop the best tools for managing your identity and keeping it
secure.  While I'm curious to see what the business model will actually be in running an Identity Provider, this model
is certainly in the best interest of the end-user.

So how do you actually delegate your OpenID to another server?  It's actually relatively simple, even if you're doing it
by hand.  All it requires is a couple of lines of code at the top of your webpage that identifies what server you want
to use, and the ID that server knows you as.  This plugin does just that, but gives you a nice interface for managing it
and won't break when you change themes.  [Eran Sandler][] actually has [another plugin][] that does this exact thing;
it's a little simpler in implementation but he has much better user documentation in the config screens... hey Eran, you
interested in working together?
