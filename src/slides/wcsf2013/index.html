            <p>I'm an engineer in Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/">Open
              Source Programs Office</a>, where we provide technical and policy infrastructure for
            Google's various open source efforts.  We help ensure that Google complies with the
            licenses of the open source software we use internally, help Googlers release their code
            as open source, and support the broader open source community through events like the
            Google Summer of Code.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I love to hack on WordPress, mainly for my own use and enjoyment,
            but I also maintain a <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/willnorris">handful of
              plugins</a>.</p>

            <p>But before we really look at <b>how</b> to contribute, I'd like to talk a little
            about <b>why</b> I contribute.</p>

            <p>If you're not familiar with the history of WordPress, it actually started as a fork
            of another system called <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2</a>.  In early 2003, the
            future of b2 was in question after its maintainer had been missing in action for several
            months.  Out of concern over the <a

              website</a>, (and thanks to the open source license b2 had been released under) Matt,
            together with fellow b2 user Mike Little, forked b2 to create what would later become
            WordPress.</p>

            <p>Matt's point about open source being one of the best learning opportunities available
            is absolutely right, and I completely agree because this is part of what got me involved
            with WordPress for Android.  I had been wanting to learn Android development for a
            while, and had started a few small projects, but it never really took.  Getting involved
            in an established open source project did much more for learning Android than any number
            of tutorials could have.  You have to apply those lessons for them to be really sink
            in.</p>
            
            <p>But just learning Android wasn't the primary underlying reason that I got
            involved.</p>

          <section>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharecropping">Sharecropping</a> is a system of
            agriculture in which a landowner allows a tenant to use the land in return for a share
            of the crops produced on the land.  The sharecroppers didn't own the land they lived and
            worked on, and in most cases didn't own the equipment they worked with.  They received
            their wage and nothing more, with no real opportunity to advance.</p>

            <p>Most of today's popular services are a modern-day equivalent to sharecropping with
            data.  Users are allowed to use the service at little or no cost, but often have limited
            ownership of their own contributions, are subject to the policies and terms of service
            for the site, and almost never have control of how their content is accessed
            (specifically, the URL for the content uses a domain name owned by the service).</p>

            <ul>
              <li>What happens when the service decides that your content violates their community
              guidelines? (Blogger and Tumblr are both changing their policies surrounding adult
              content)</li>
              <li>Or that your chosen name doesn't meet their name policies?  (Facebook and Google+
              have so-called "real name" or "common name" policies that have caused problems for
              users with non-traditional names)</li>
              <li>Or what happens when a large company decides they really want your chosen
              username, and the site is willing to give it to them?  (This has happened with
              both Twitter and Tumblr, among others)
            </ul>

            <p>What happens to your data then?  Many services now let your export your data in some
            format, but what about the URLs?  In most cases, you'll never be able to redirect those
            to wherever you decide to move your data.</p>

            <p>Despite the issues around data ownership and control, these types of services are
            flourishing, and for very good reason.  They work really, really well.  And their user
            experience is <em>really</em> good, particularly on mobile.</p>

                  - provides an incredibly simple interface for taking pictures, applying some basic
                  filters, and then sharing them with friends.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus">Google+</a></strong>
                - one of the first a applications to auto-upload your photos, also with a great UI
                for composing and sharing content
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest">Pinterest</a></strong>

                the web, they also have a great mobile experience for browsing pinboards.

              <li>
                <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.home">Facebook Home</a></strong>
                - even if you don't really like the idea of a Facebook powered home screen, it's
                hard to deny that the application <em>looks</em> great.  Chat heads in particular
                have received a great response, even from folks critical of the rest of the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.vine.android">Vine</a></strong>
                - Vine did for video what Instagram originally did for photos, making it very simple
                to create and share simple videos.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path">Path</a></strong>
                - one of the first successful social networks to launch with a mobile-only strategy,
                they certainly set the bar for mobile social apps
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are some of the best mobile experiences in the industry, but they all feed into
            data silos and sharecropped accounts.  Now I don't fundamentally have a problem with
            these services. In fact, I've found myself consuming and sharing content on mobile a lot
            more recently. But I really would like to maintain more ownership of my data and have
            control over how it is accessed.</p>
            
            <p>While I don't personally use my phone or tablet for long-form blogging, why shouldn't
            the mobile experience for sharing content on my own WordPress site, where I do have
            complete control and ownership of the data, just as good as these other services?
            Programmers often talk about making the "right way" to do something also be the easiest
            way.  Shouldn't that principal apply here as well?</p>

          <section>
            <p>Of course, I'm not the only one who cares deeply about owning my own data.</p>

            <p><a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> is an annual event in Portland,
            Oregon timed to be the weekend following <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open
              Source Bridge</a>; we just had the third IndieWebCamp last month.</p>

            <p>The indie web itself is actually a really simple concept... it's about owning your
            identity and your content online.  It starts by owning a domain name, and using the
            domain to publish your content.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that the indie web is not about eschewing the silos
            altogether.  That's actually where many previous, similar efforts have failed.  The goal
            here is to leverage these larger services for the social connection they provide, but to
            participate on them in a way that puts you in more control.</p>

            <p>Publishing content can happen in two different ways.</p>
            
            <p>The preferred model is one where you initially publish to your own site, and then
            syndicate elsewhere.  This frees you from the arbitrary constrains of any one network,
            such as Twitter's character limit.  When you syndicate out to these networks, you
            provide a link back to your original, full fidelity content.</p>

            <p>The second model is one where you initially publish elsewhere, and then syndicate
            back to your own site.  This ensures that you still have copy of your data, but puts you
            at the mercy of the site you are publishing to.</p>

            <p>Finally, the indie web puts a strong emphasis on the notion of self-dogfooding.  The
            idea of dogfooding, or using one's own product, is relatively common in tech companies.
            Self-dogfooding takes that one step further, and applies it to your personal day-to-day
            life (not just your day job).  We've discovered that this results in many cases, this
            results in better results in less time because the creators is actually buliding it for
            themselves.</p>

            <p>Self-dogfooding is about doing what works for you right now.  Start where are are

            having.</p>

            <p>As you look into the different ways you can get involved with open source, you're
            going to find that this principal applies there as well. There are tons of opportunities
            to contribute no matter where you are starting from, especially with a project like
            WordPress.  Just do what you can.</p>

            <p>So for me, that starting point was a desire to have a better experience for sharing
            content on WordPress from my mobile device.</p>

            <p>In December of 2012 <a href="https://willnorris.com/2012/12/all-https-all-the-time">I
              decided</a>, partly out of principal and partly just as an experiment, to require all
            traffic on my personal site to happen over a secure HTTPS connection.</p>

            <p>Due to where my site was being hosted at the time, I used a feature known as <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">Server Name Indication</a>.
             Typically, a server must have a unique IP address for each secure website it hosts,
             making it expensive, if not impossible, to host a secure site on a typical shared
             hosting plan.  SNI allows multiple secure sites to be served from a single IP
             address, significantly lowering the barrier to entry.  Browser support for SNI is
             good with the latest version of IE, and the last several versions of other major
             browsers.  Support in various HTTP libraries is spotty at best.</p>

              SNI</a>.  For more recent versions of Android, HttpURLConnection is recommended.  At
            the time, WordPress for Android used the Apache client which wouldn't work with my
            site.</p>

            <p>Now to be fair, it doesn't really surprise me that this hadn't been noticed before.
            I only ran into it because I was using the WordPress for Android app, AND I have SSL
            enabled for my site, AND I am using SSL with SNI.  I don't imagine that there are a very
            large number of people who meet this criteria, so the number of effected users is
            probably pretty low.  But for me, this was an absolutely critical problem, since it
            prevented me from using the app at all.</p>

            <p>One of my very first contributions to WordPress for Android was to scratch one of my
            own itches.  I switched the app to use the newer HTTP client which did support SNI, and
            was thereby able to use the app with my personal website.</p>

            <p>I've discovered that whatever the reason for why you want to contribute will often
            lead you to how you ought to contribute.  And I've found that some of the best
            contributors to open source projects are those who have a specific pursuit in mind, a
            goal they are trying to accomplish.</p>

            <p>Matt had the specific goal of ensuring that he would have a blogging platform to
            continue using.  For me, I first just wanted to get the Android app working with my
            website.</p>
            
            <p>As a newcomer to a project, a prerequisite for contributing to a project is first
            understanding it.  This is a really important role, because so often the getting started
            process doesn't get documented as well as it could.</p>
            
            <p>But as a secondary motivation, I wanted to have a great experience for
            publishing content to my own site from my phone, rather than feeling drawn to publish
            content into data silos.</p>

            time to try to improve the WordPress UX on Android, I truly "used what I had", which was
            pencil and paper.  I read a lot about <a

            watched a lot of <a href="http://androiddesigninaction.com">Android Design in Action</a> (which

            <p>So often, when you're getting paid to work on a project or codebase, you tend not to
            have as much freedom to work on the parts you really want to.  You have to work on what
            the client really wants, or the highest priority bugs.  Not that there's anything wrong
            with that, those are important and of course need to get done.  But I've found that when
            it comes to the projects I really love and work on for fun, getting paid to work on them
            can take the fun out of it.</p>

            <p>When I started contributing to WordPress for Android, the core team was focused on
            other features that weren't as interesting to me at the time.  But I was still able to
            work on the features that were important to me, as long as I got buy-in from the core
            team.</p>

            This quote was part of an internal Google+ post discussing feature
            requests and bug reports between different teams at Google.  Google's
            code base is sort of setup like a giant open source project.  With
            only a handful of exceptions, every engineer at Google has the
            ability to view just about any line of code for any product.  Because
            of this, it is very easy for an engineer to send a patch to another
            team to fix a bug or add a new feature.  More importantly, this mode
            of contributing to other projects around the company is very much a
            part of the culture at Google.  Googlers are empowered and encouraged
            (expected, even) to push for changes they believe in.
