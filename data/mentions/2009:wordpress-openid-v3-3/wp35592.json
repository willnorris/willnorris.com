    "html": "<p>For of all, thank you for the release. I am one of the many that have asked, many times, to get OpenID as part of the WordPress core. I consider this important, and a good replacement for the current WordPress login mechanism. Yet, I have gotten much resistance from wordpress.org.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps as the main developer of this plugin you could weight in and endorse the inclusion of OpenID as part of the WordPress core. Perhaps they will listen to you.</p>\n",
