I'll be <data class="p-rsvp" value="yes">attending</data> <a rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to"
href="http://2016.indieweb.org/">IndieWeb Summit</a> in Portland next week,  probably working on the
[go microformats library](/go/microformats) which I started focusing on a few weeks ago as part of a
webmention service I've been thinking about lately.  As I've been working on that library though,
I've found a few discrepancies between the different popular microformat libraries, so there's a
pretty good chance I'll spend at least a little time building a little service to compare the
results from those.
