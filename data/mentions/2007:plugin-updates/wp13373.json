When I placed the second comment, I was already logged in.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the gravatar thing is related to the Anonymous problem (I noticed you put that on the wish list).  The Anonymous post about Quoter was me as well.  I was logged out before placing that comment, too.  It might also be related to the permissions I was giving when logging in. Several of the times that I've posted here, I've only given permission for the single login.  But when I made the gravatar post, I gave permission forever.</p>\n\n<p>re: Point 3 -- Looks like there's a filter #get_comment_author_link that might do the trick.  I'll play around with it to see.</p>\n",
