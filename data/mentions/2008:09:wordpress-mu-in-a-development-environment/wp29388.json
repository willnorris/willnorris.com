If you're doing this from the virtual server itself, you'll want to add the following:\r\n\r\n<pre>127.0.0.1  wp.mu</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you're connected from a different machine (like the host machine which the virtual one is running on), you'll change the IP address to be the IP of the virtual server.",
