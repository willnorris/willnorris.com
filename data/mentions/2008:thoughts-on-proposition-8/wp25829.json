    "html": "I'm gay and as you'd expect I don't want to redefine marriage and loose my right, but there's an even more important issue underlying all this I haven't heard anyone talk about.\r\n\r\nNot all churches are opposed to same-sex marriage. The United Church of Christ is just one example of a church which has embraced same-sex marriage, and they along with any other church which supports equal marriage rights would loose the freedom to marry who they want because they don't share the official state interpretation of the bible. This is the establishment of religion, plain and simple. \r\n\r\nAs things stand right now, your church is not being required to marry same-sex couples unless you want to and you are free to condemn me all you want.",
