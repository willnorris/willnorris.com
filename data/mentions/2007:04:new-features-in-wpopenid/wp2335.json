    "html": "[quote comment=\"2326\"]On the same topic (OpenID, JanRain, etc), you mentioned they have published and RC for 2.0, was that on the PHP Library? I looked and only saw Python. I would not mind using the RC, to report bugs, etc.[/quote]\r\nThey've published an RC for both <a href=\"http://lists.openidenabled.com/pipermail/dev/2007-April/000401.html\">Python</a> and <a href=\"http://lists.openidenabled.com/pipermail/dev/2007-April/000411.html\">PHP</a>.  I believe there are a few API changes, so the PHP one likely won't work with this plugin yet, but I haven't tested it.",
