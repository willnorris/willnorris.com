Not to mention that it hasn't been developed for over a year.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any chance this will be fixed, or should everyone look for alternatives? I'm afraid while there are several viable alternatives, they all create user records rather than just post identified comments, which I find unacceptable.</p>\n",
