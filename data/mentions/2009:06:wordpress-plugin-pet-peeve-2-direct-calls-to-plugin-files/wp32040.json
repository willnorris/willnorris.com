It´s a gold nugget &amp; saved me heaps of time.</p>\n\n<p>I used the process while writing a shop-plugin fpr wordpress that implements onpage price calculation for the variations of a product (via ajax). Since it all has to come within one plugin, including the ajax-handler that needs to do requests to the normal wp-functions, your post described exactly what I had to do.</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn´t have known otherwise. Thx again!</p>\n",
