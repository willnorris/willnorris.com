Because I don't like the idea of delegating an ID all over the net when I have my own host.</blockquote>\r\nno, this is simply a plugin for consuming OpenIDs, either for commenting or for logging in to existing accounts.  The role of acting as an OpenID server is quite different, and should probably stay in a separate plugin.  In fact, there are a number of projects that provide an OpenID server (notably <a href=\"http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/\">phpMyID</a>), that can easily be installed along side wordpress.",
