    "html": "<p>For many years Semantic Web technologies have been weak on\n(distributed) authentication and the like, so it's quite funny to see\nthe question \"So what's the equivalent [of LDAP] in the decentralized\nOpenID world?\".</p>\n\n<p>The decentralised OpenID world is the Web, and the Web of Data story\nis pretty well figured out with RDF (check the material around <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data\">Linked Data</a>).\nSpecifically for the LDAP kind of situation, you'd probably want FOAF\n+ vCard/RDF terms.</p>\n\n<p>Microformats like hCard are consistent with this, and can be directly\ninterpreted as RDF using <a\nhref=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-primer/\">GRDDL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(I forgot to mention there's now a foaf:openid property)</p>\n",
