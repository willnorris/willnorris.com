The codex describes the method to perform Ajax calls on the admin and frontend sides. You need to include the wp-config.php to get the site url... I fully agree on the fact that this may cause some problems if the installation uses non standard paths but I don't get from your note the way to deal with that... I should have missed something...</p>\n",
