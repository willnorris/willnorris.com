Just figured I'd toss my idea out in response to Slashdot's [recent article][] about uses of google maps.  I think it'd
be very interesting to get ahold of all the speeding tickets written in a given area (should be available under the
FOIA, no?) and overlay that on a city map.  Shouldn't be too difficult to find the hot spots where you're most likely to
get ticketed.  Would be nice when travelling too.
