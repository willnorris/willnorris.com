In order to get the \"Google juice\" from .name to be pushed over to .com, I have to use an HTTP redirect.  However, if I do that, then the OpenID will be redirected as well.  Technically I'm supposed to be able to use a 303 redirect, which should not effect the OpenID stuff, but few libraries handle that properly.  Realistically, I'm just going to have to choose one or the other.",
