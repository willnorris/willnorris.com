I'm sure people are tired of me talking about how soon this will be released, so I promise I'll shut up now.  I've just
tagged version 2.0 of wp-openid, a WordPress plugin which allows you to use OpenID for authenticating users and
commenters.  There are a number of really cool features we just weren't able to get into this release, so that just
means more to come in the next version.  Go [download it][] and have fun.  Release notes, screenshots, FAQ, install
instructions, etc can all be found there.  I'll probably be unplugged most of the weekend, so try not to break anything
too bad. ;)
