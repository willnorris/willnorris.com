    "html": "[quote comment=\"2228\"]Your plugin seems to work for most people, though I have encountered  problem while testing it on my blog. I can't access any article in IE 7, I just see a blank page.\r\nI am running a K2 derivative, http://www.obharath.net/blog/2006/12/17/3-column-k2-093/, on WordPress 2.1.2. I have disabled AJAX commenting but it didn't work either.\r\nDo you have any idea what might be the problem?[/quote]\r\nWhat version of the plugin are you running?  if running r13, try upgrading to the latest one in subversion.. there are a couple of updates there that haven't made it out yet.  If that doesn't work, let me know what version of PHP you're using so I can try and recreate the environment here.  (also, I'm posting this comment from IE7 just to make sure I'm not having problems with it)",
