    "html": "<p>Tantek seems to be <a href=\"http://tantek.com/w/Whistle#design\">following precedent</a> regarding the trailing slash:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>b - blog post specific short URL design: /b/SSSn (prefer /x/ design per Flic.kr precedent, extensibility)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also considered the durability of URLs, particularly with \"what if I leave WordPress\".  For me personally, I'm not willing to change the permalink structure of my blog to something that allows for fully algorithmic url expansion.  I'm pretty heavily invested in WordPress already, and don't see myself switching anytime soon.  If and when I do, then I'll deal with it then :).  It's certainly a trade-off, but one I made consciously.</p>\n",
