Yeah, Texas.  Not Los Angeles.  I've gotten into the habit of walking about a bit every night before I go to bed to
[look out][] over the city.  Last night, I happened to count all the stars that I could see... I came up with a measly
18.  Then I counted the planes and helicoptors... 19.  Heh, that's LA for ya.
