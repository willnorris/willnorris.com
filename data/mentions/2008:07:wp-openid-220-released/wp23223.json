The linking only works when I point <em>directly</em> to the server's location - the header s at my homepage aren't followed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the process just completed first time when I tested posting an OpenID comment while logged out of my local mirror of my blog. Could be because it's a local mirror, could be because I was using IE to avoid logging out of Fx, could be because I was logged out...who knows.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/diso/issues/detail?id=75&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Project%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary\">I submitted a bug report about it the other day.</a>\r\n\r\n(Another bug: this comment wouldn't submit until I entered a name and e-mail!)",
