Expected http://lifeasitcomes.com/, got http://lifeasitcomes.com/?action=verify\r\n\r\nError: Unable to authenticate OpenID.[/quote]\r\n\r\nI get the same error. This happens when trying to add OpenID URLs to an account through the profile page.\r\n\r\nI've tried pinpointing what's wrong, but I'm in the dark since I don't know enough about the standard.\r\n\r\nWhat I found is that parameters are missing when they are being checked for in _verifyReturnToArgs (Auth/OpenID/Consumer.php) during the check of $bare_args = $message-&gt;getArgs(Auth_OpenID_BARE_NS);\r\n\r\nHopefully this can help you in pinpointing and fixing the problem.\r\n\r\n/Nathan",
