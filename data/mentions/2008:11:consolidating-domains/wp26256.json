I could simply use \r\n<pre>    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" /&gt;</pre>\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Google won't transfer the reputation I've built up on .name over to .com in that case.  In order for Google to transfer that reputation over, I have to do an actual redirect (possibly even a 301 - permanent redirect)",
