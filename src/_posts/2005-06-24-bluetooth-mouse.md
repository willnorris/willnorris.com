If anyone is shopping for a portable bluetooth mouse, allow me to heartily recommend the [BT500][] by [RadTech][].  I
first heard about this mouse from a [review][] on macslash, and decided to try it out.  It's a bit smaller than I was
expecting, but that is certainly okay with me.  The best thing about it is how responsive it is -- I've been really
turned off by BT mice because they take a split second to respond to movement, but that is certainly not the case with
this mouse.  I especially love the power switch to turn the mouse off when I'm not using it.  I payed the extra amount
to get the little case for it, though it is a little bulky... not sure that I'd recommend the case if you're looking to
just toss the mouse in your laptop bag.

On a side note, why is it that mini mice are shaped basically the same as full sized mice?  Most full sized mice have a
bulge at the back that comfortably and naturally fits in the palm of your hand when you grip the entire mouse.  A mini
mouse is not designed to rest in your palm, yet it still has same basic bulge... it just doesn't make sense to use the
same design.  I'm not sure what I'd recommend, but they should really take another look at what design actually makes
sense when it's only intended to be used with your fingertips.
