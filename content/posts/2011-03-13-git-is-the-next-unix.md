[Avery Pennarun](http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=200801#31) in 2008:

> With git, we've invented a new world where revision history, checksums, and branches don't make your filesystem
> slower: they make it **faster**. They don't make your data bigger: they make it **smaller**. They don't risk your data
> integrity; they **guarantee integrity**. They don't centralize your data in a big database; they **distribute** it
> peer to peer.
