    "html": "I am on a PC that runs Windows XP Home Edition (my Mac died last week and should get it back in a few days) and xampp for php, mysql, apache stuff.  I just installed Wordpress and the openid+ plugin locally.  after browsing for patches to fix the blank pages and comments not showing unless logged in issues, i finally got most things to work.  One major thing that doesn't work is the openid authentication.  \r\n\r\nas i mentioned before, i am running this locally.  after getting redirected to myopenid provider and authenticated, i was sent back to the wp login page with this error: OpenID Authentication Failed: Server denied check_authentication.  is that because i am running everything in my local box now?  or is there something that i am missing?\r\n\r\ni checked out the latest codes from your repository (r30).\r\n\r\nthanks for the help.",
