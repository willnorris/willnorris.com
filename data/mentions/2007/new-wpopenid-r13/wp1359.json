Yours is much nicer than the code in the readme.</blockquote>\r\nActually, I'm just using what is built in to the plugin... I've got the last three options checked -- \"Comment Form\", \"Internal Style\", and \"Unobtrusive Mode\".  <s>I don't have \"Login Form\" checked because it does some really funny style stuff, and just haven't had a chance to fix that yet.</s>\r\n\r\nUpdate: I now have all four options checked for this site... just need a little CSS tweak to hide the login form from the main page.",
