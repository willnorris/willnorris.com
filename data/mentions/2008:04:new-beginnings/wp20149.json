Our daughter is getting married there in a bit over a month.</p>\n\n<p>As a fellow Christian I thought I could at least send my congrats, and wish you and your wife all the best. (You are moving up into my neck 'o the woods, but I'm guessing we'll never cross paths; my music is a bit ... well ... older (?) ... different (?) ... that what you probably like.)</p>\n\n<p>Cheers and Be God's-\npm</p>\n\n<p>(No, I don't expect you to respond ... just couldn't help commenting. You make a beautiful couple!)</p>\n",
