    "html": "I installed v2.2.1 (on WP 2.4.1), and no longer seem to be able to post comments when your plugin is activated. I get the following error when wp-comments-post.php runs:\r\n\r\n<code>You must submit a comment using the comment form.</code>\r\n\r\nI checked the plugin's status info, which displays a failure for Big Integer support:\r\n\r\n<code>[FAIL] Big Integer support: The OpenID Library is operating in Dumb Mode. Recommend installing GMP support.</code>\r\n\r\nAre there any workarounds I could apply? Comments can be posted if I turn off openid, but of course that means no openid support for my site.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
