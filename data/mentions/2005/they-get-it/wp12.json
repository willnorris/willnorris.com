    "html": "I agree whole heartedly that Apple gets it, for the most part. Their method of advertising since the return of Steve Jobs has been a little peculiar, but I now believe(or at least I tell myself) that Jobs understands the power of evangelism and super-duper design. Those are two things that Apple has going for it way more than any other hardware or software company that I'm aware of. The fact that Apple has such a cult following and loyalty has undoubtedly formed an unshakable customer base that may prove to be part of a much shrewder marketing strategy that ensures it's existence over the long term, long after some other OSes have been eaten alive by viruses and consumer dissatisfaction.\r\n    One other company I'd like to mention is Blizzard Entertainment. I think it's safe to say that not only are their games really engaging and fun, but they're consistent and don't try to be all things to all people. Years ago in the days of the early days of Warcraft and later Starcraft, people would say, \"There are hardly any games for the Mac\". After the obligatory eye-roll, my response was always to point out Blizzard and say, \"The BEST games are for the Mac.\" Just my two cents, (which is all I have left after buying Macs all these years.)",
