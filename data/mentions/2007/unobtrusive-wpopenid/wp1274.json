In trying to address the name/email issue I mentioned in my last comment, I found a larger problem with the way wpopenid interacts with other plugins that filter comments.  I'm going to be working on that, and I'll look at version compatibility as well.</p>\n\n<p>I did manage to email Alan (I was using .com instead of .net, doh!), but I haven't heard back from him yet.  This is turning out to be some pretty major changes, so I'd like to see them committed upstream, if possible.  Otherwise, I might have to make this an unofficial fork.</p>\n",
