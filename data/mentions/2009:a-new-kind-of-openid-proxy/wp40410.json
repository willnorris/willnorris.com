    "html": "<p>I am wondering if I should build something like this and offer it as a service? I would much prefer for it to already exist...  I wonder if you or Michael would like to do that?</p>\n\n<p>I would like to build a client app that only supports either directed (like google or those generated from a proxy like this) or opaque (like Yahoos) identities. But I cannot build a client like that and say \"only Google/Yahoo users can login\" it kind of defeats the point of OpenID.. I would like to be able to insist that other OpenID providers be forwarded over to this directed id proxy so that I can ensure that any OpenID user can login, but that they are psuedonymous from my applications perspective...</p>\n\n<p>What would be your interest level for such a project be? If you were interested what would be the timeframe?</p>\n\n<p>It seems pretty trivial technically, but it would be have to be a pretty long term hosting commitment...</p>\n\n<p>-FT</p>\n",
