I entered openid.ee as the website URL and the comment got a really obvious Anonymous name even.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately on my site it doesn't work that smoothly. I probably should work with templates a bit. Also Spam Karma did not like the post with the anonymous URL.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that - great plugin, shall use it, thanks!</p>\n",
