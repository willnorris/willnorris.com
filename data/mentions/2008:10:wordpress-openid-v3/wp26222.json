    "html": "Hi Will. I'm experiencing issues where I'm already including jQuery 1.2.6 in the theme, and then the plugin includes an older version too. Is there a possible workaround for this? I've tried to stop the plugin from including the jQuery script (function openid_js_setup()) but didn't have much luck. Any ideas? Thanks.",
