    "html": "The State's role in society is to guarantee fairness, freedom, and opportunity for all its citizens. State-defended fairness guarantees everyone the right to express faith however they choose. Churches can and should be able to practice however they choose.\r\n\r\nIt must also guarantee everyone the right and opportunity to express their love and commitment however they choose.\r\n\r\nNo on Prop 8 isn't about compelling any Church to change its definition or recognition of marriage. I don't think I would support that. No in Prop 8 *is* about giving all Citizens equal rights under the law. \r\n\r\nI'm for fairness and will be voting No on Prop 8.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThanks to Will and all the commenters for such a civilized discussion. It's a nice treat to find a welcoming place outside the standard echo chambers. Civilized discussions like these are what keeps America on the path towards being a evermore perfect union.",
