    "html": "Everyone seems to assume and virtually no one challenges the view that marriage is a religious institution.\r\n\r\nMatrimony has indeed become a sacrament of christian churches, but rather late in the history of Christianity, really.\r\n\r\nMarriage was for centuries a secular issue and consisted essentially on publicizing the union of the couple. Sometimes, these unions were blessed by the religious institution du jour but it was only relatively recently that christian churches took hold of marriage and made it a central part of their faith, promoting the ceremony to the status of sacrament.\r\n\r\nSo, I wouldn't say marriage is a religious issue. It is simply a contract by which two people publicly commit to each other, which the State then recognizes for a series of legal purposes.",
