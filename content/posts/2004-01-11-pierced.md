i just got my lip pierced... again.  I had it pierced a few months ago but had some problems with it, but am trying it
again now.  It's in the center this time instead of the side... just decided I liked the look of this better.  In other,
though somewhat related news, I got a "promotion" at work.  I'm not sure that it is really a promotion per se, but
rather just a change.  Instead of working with any and every random student or faculty member that may call the
helpdesk, I now work exclusively with the upper administration - president's office, VP's office, some financial
workers, etc.  It's promises to be a lot of fun and little challenging.  The nicest thing will be having a consistent
user base instead of working with different people everyday.  This way I can begin to learn the tendencies of each user
and get to know them a little.  Plus it should look pretty good on a resume. :)  Only downside is that I now have to
dress up for work a little... polo and slacks or the like.  Not my style really, but it's a small price to pay.  I'm not
sure how the new lip ring will go over, but I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
