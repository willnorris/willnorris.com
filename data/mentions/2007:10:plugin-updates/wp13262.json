    "html": "@Shack, well it looks like your PHP was configured without PEAR.  I thought that PEAR_Log didn't depend on the rest of pear and could be used standalone, but I guess I didn't look close enough.  I'll need to work out another way to do logging I guess.  <a href=\"http://willnorris.com/about#contact\">Contact me</a> directly and I'll let you know when I've got something new for you to try.\r\n\r\n<strong>update:</strong> Actually it is a standalone module, so PEAR isn't the problem.  I believe it may be your include_path, so I've made a couple of changes.  Try the latest in SVN and let me know how it goes.",
