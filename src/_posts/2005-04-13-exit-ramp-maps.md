I'm leaving later this afternoon to drive to Nashville and so I went to [google maps][] this morning to double check my
directions.  I found a good map of where I was going and was pretty sure I determined which exit I wanted, but couldn't
quite tell if the exit ramp went the direction I needed.  Google satellite photos to the rescue...

I also got a nice shot of all the [parking lots][] around the area.  Imagine how useful that would be for a downtown
event.
