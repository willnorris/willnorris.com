I've long kept my WordPress sites in version control (and if you're not doing the same, [let Mark Jaquith tell you why
you should][mj-video]), and I typically pull in themes and plugins as git submodules.  I recently purchased the [Genesis
Theme][] to use on a website I'm building for my church, and I'm trying to figure out how best to put it in version
control.

Because Genesis is a paid theme, I don't really want to put it in a public GitHub repository, and thereby allow anyone
to use it without paying.  Though to be clear, it's licensed under the GPL so I would have every right to post it
publicly, I just don't really want to.  But it also seems wasteful to use one of my few private repos on GitHub just for
this.  It'd be really great if StudioPress had a git repo that paying customers had read access to that they could use
for exactly this purpose.  They have a [GitHub account][], so maybe there's a private repo behind there and I just can't
see it?

I'm curious how others are handling this for Genesis, or any other paid WordPress plugin or theme that is also open
source.
