For a while now, I've had two different personal websites. I have my personal blog at [willnorris.com][], which you're
reading now.  And I also have my "identity site" at [will.norris.name][], which includes my hcard, activity stream,
contact list, and a list of my profiles on various websites.  I've also used this identity site as my primary OpenID for
quite a while.  

[willnorris.com]: /
[will.norris.name]: http://will.norris.name/

I've been considering consolidating these down into a single site, putting my activity stream on the front page and my
blog under a sub-directory.  Of course I'll setup proper redirects and such so that no links will be broken.  I can also
update my OpenID at all of the services I use, so that's not really a problem.  .com as a TLD is certainly more familiar
with people, but the .name is technically the "correct" TLD for individuals.  So now I'm relying on others to give me
input... which domain should I use?
