It says \"Status Information\" Click on \"toggle more/less\" \r\n   Below the line about \"library: BCMath\" there may be a line about \"Loaded long integer library\". If there is at it says \"FAIL\" then report that.  If the line doesn't exist, then it is OK\r\n\r\n\r\n@Will: You may want to make that line appear even if it's OK. It is confusing otherwise.\r\n\r\nCiao!",
