    "html": "Tony, I certainly understand your point.  Unfortunately, I've not studied apologetics very much, so I don't have an immediate answer for you.  Each of the four principles I mentioned at the beginning of the post could all be scrutinized and argued ad nauseam, but it would really miss the point of my argument.  We all have principles that we do and do not believe, and those principles guide the decisions we make everyday.  \r\n\r\nWhat this discussion has proven so far, and how I'd like to continue to steer it, is that we don't need to agree on everything.  I'm not sure that anyone who has commented has entirely agreed with what I believe, and that's okay... in fact that's the point.  It seems we do however all agree that governmental law should be non-discriminatory, and that the legal unions between two people should be separate from religious unions between two people (whatever labels you want to attach to each).  \r\n\r\nI think the path to convincing conservatives to vote NO on prop 8 is not to try and convince them that they are being intolerant and should accept homosexuality as a morally acceptable lifestyle. I promise you won't win that argument, because it is based on an individual's personal beliefs about homosexuality.  I think a better approach is to help them realize that they have every right to their view, but that the California Constitution is not the appropriate forum for it... the church is.",
