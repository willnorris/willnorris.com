A month or two ago, I was talking with a friend of mine before church one Sunday.  It was a couple of weeks before he
was getting married, and we were talking about the anticipation of it all when he said one of the sweetest things I've
heard in a long time.  He said the hardest part about it all was having to leave his fiancee every night and have to say
goodbye; he had figured out that he was only going to have to do that something like 13 more times.  He was counting
down to his wedding not by days, but by goodbyes.  I'm not a songwriter, but if I were I would write a song about that
-- "Counting down the goodbyes".
