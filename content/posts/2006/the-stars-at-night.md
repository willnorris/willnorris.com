Yeah, Texas. Not Los Angeles. I've gotten into the habit of walking about a bit every night before I go to bed to
[look out][] over the city. Last night, I happened to count all the stars that I could see... I came up with a measly 18. Then I counted the planes and helicoptors... 19. Heh, that's LA for ya.
