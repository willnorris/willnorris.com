Remy took his <a href="https://remysharp.com/2023/09/26/no-more-404" class="u-like-of">No More 404</a>
idea and turned it into a hosted service,
<a href="https://remysharp.com/2023/12/04/unrot-that-link" class="u-like-of">unrot</a>,
and it's really neat.
Setting it up was a [piece of cake], as was [modifying things] to proxy all communication through my site.

So now, old links like <https://haveamint.com/> will automatically redirect to archive.org.
