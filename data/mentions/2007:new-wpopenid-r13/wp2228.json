I can't access any article in IE 7, I just see a blank page.\r\nI am running a K2 derivative, http://www.obharath.net/blog/2006/12/17/3-column-k2-093/, on WordPress 2.1.2. I have disabled AJAX commenting but it didn't work either.\r\nDo you have any idea what might be the problem?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nCarsten",
