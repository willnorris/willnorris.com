It should come as no surprise that Zeldman's post <cite>[This is a Website][]</cite> resonated with me heaviliy:

> We were struggling, whether we knew it or not, to found a more fluid society. A place where everyone, not just
> appointed apologists for the status quo, could be heard. That dream need not die. It matters more now than ever.
