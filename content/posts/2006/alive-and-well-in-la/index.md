I still don't have a lot of free time to get online (no internet at home yet), but I wanted to at least let everyone
know I'm doing well here in Los Angeles.  The drive over was pretty uneventful, as was my first week of work -- mostly
paperwork and apartment hunting.  I wound up finding a really great place in the [Silver Lake area][].  I'm living in a
guy's pool house in a really nice gated community with a phenomenal view of the city.  It's a little small, but given
the view, how close it is to USC, how safe the neighborhood is, and the price I'm getting it for, I'm certainly not
complaining.  Anyway, pictures of everything are posted over at [flickr][].
