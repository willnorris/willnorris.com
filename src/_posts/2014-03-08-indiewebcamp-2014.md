There's only a couple of hours left in [IndieWebCamp SF 2014](https://indieweb.org/2014/SF), and it's been a really
productive weekend.

I mostly got [Webmentions](http://webmention.org/) working last year, but my implementation wasn't good enough that it
stuck... I ending up disabling things before too long.  This year, the WordPress plugin is in much better shape, I'm
using a much better WordPress theme (Genesis), and [brid.gy](http://brid.gy) exists to bridge my site with various
silos.  Now, interactions on Google+, Facebook, and Twitter are retrieved by brid.gy, converted to webmentions, sent to
my site, and stored as local comments.  There's still a little work to do to have likes and +1s to be displayed as a
facepile, rather than a regular comment, but it's definitely good enough for now.

We also spent a lot of time talking through the challenges of running a site with HTTPS, and what levels of SSL support
people should try to achieve and where that fits in with [IndieMark](https://indieweb.org/IndieMark).  I'm not sure
if all the notes have made it into the wiki yet, but the [etherpad from the session is available][https-etherpad].

Finally, I really came to realize that we have a **long** way to go to make it easier for WordPress users to get set up
on the indie web.  Though I'm happy to report that [Dan Gillmor][], [Scott Jenson][], and [Darius Dunlap][] also got
their WordPress sites up and running with webmentions and brid.gy.
