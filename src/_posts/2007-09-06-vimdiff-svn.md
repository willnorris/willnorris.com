I keep all projects of any importance in a subversion repository... it's just good practice.  I also make heavy use of [vimdiff][] to diff two files within the vim editor.  Tonight I discovered [vimdiff-svn][], a simple shell script that is included in, of all things, [KDE][].  It allows you to leverage vimdiff to view changes made to a file managed by subversion... just what I've wanted for a while, but never took the time to find.
