a read at [slashdot](http://slashdot.org) was very discouraging for those of us adamantly fighting the good fight
against spammers.  According to [this](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/06/1831256) article at Wired, a company
that sells these pills accidentally put one of their order logs online or something.  It revealed ~6,000 responses to
these spam messages in a 4 week period.  How can that many people be that stupid?  However, I can't help but wonder if
the company faked the logs and put them online on purpose to make it appear as though they were doing so much business.
A former employee of the company even "reported the company's tendency to expose order log files", so it sounds a little
fishy to me.  Either way, I'm really getting tired of spam - I'm approaching an average of 50 per day on my personal
accounts... almost all of it on my panheads.org.  ugh.
