The [local Apple Store][] was having their monthly fire sale this weekend, and thanks to the new [iPod Nano][]s
requiring some counter space I got a great deal on one of the old [iPod Shuffle][] demo units.  I decided to test the
battery capacity by cycling it a few times, and discovered something interesting I've never heard advertised or
mentioned before -- they automatically pause if you unplug the headphones.  I'm not sure how useful that really is, but
is certainly doesn't hurt anything; why would you want the music to continue if you can't hear it?  Unless of course you
are intentionally just trying to drain the batteries like I am (which is no simple task by the way, it takes upwards of
12 hours!)

(Apparently most all of the new iPods do this, but I never noticed because I have a 3rd generation).
