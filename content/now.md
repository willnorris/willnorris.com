title: What I'm doing now

We still live near Half Moon Bay, CA,
but are right in the middle of getting ready to sell our house and move down to the Temecula, CA area.
Elisabeth's family lives there, and there are a lot of reasons right now to move.
There are also reasons to stay, so this has been a very difficult process for us.
Also being our first home, being on the selling side is a whole new experience.

I left Twitter back in May 2022 and joined Tailscale.
After 10 years of working in open source program management,
and over half of that time doing people management, I was ready to be an engineer again.
The change in my happiness and satisfaction in my job has been significant.

I haven't been reading as much as I would like.
Still mostly science fiction when I do.
I've at least switched over to short stories for a while (currently Philip K. Dick)
so that I don't get so lost after long breaks.
