    "html": "Since I'm gay, you and I are going to disagree on the morality of homosexuality and, consequently, the definition of marriage.  I hope for a day when more Christians have an inclusive view of homosexuality, where the mere definition of two members of the same sex together does not fundamentally disagree with the core values of their religion.  However, I understand this requires a more fluid interpretation of the Bible and its role in Christianity, and I respect your choice not to go down that road.\r\n\r\nI am commenting to say I appreciate that you are doing the same for me.  Thanks for respecting my beliefs and for taking the time to carefully consider my rights as an American and as a person.  Your attitude is a stellar model to follow amidst the rising trends of polarization and the inability to reach across boundaries.",
