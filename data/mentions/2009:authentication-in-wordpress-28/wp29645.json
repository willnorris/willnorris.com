    "html": "@Ramon: the plugin isn't in the WordPress directory yet... that's intentional.  It's not not quite ready for users.\r\n\r\n@Kh√ºrt: I think you're misunderstanding what OAuth is for... it's not for authenticating to a website yourself, it's for API authentication.  What you're describing is still OpenID, whether you initiate with a big button or by typing a URL.\r\n\r\n@Stephen: actually no, we haven't gotten AtomPub working yet.  I guess I just forgot :).  I'll definitely try and get those changes in before 2.8 releases.",
