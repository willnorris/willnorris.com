### wordpress ###

Well, I finally decided to ditch blosxom for a slightly more robust blogging package.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely
love blosxom and it's design philosophy... I was just running into too many problems getting plugins to inter-operate
and behave exactly as I wanted them too.  While I miss being able to just edit entries in vi, wordpress seems to address
most all of the big issues I was having with blosxom.

### layouts ###

When moving to wordpress, I tried to duplicate the old layout I had but realized it was going to take forever to
recreate the template.  I ended up making this slightly modified version of [Michael Heilemann][]'s [kubrick][]
layout... I'm rather pleased with it.  I still want to do a completely custom layout, but this is working in the
interim.  Hat's off to [Ciro][] who actually took the photograph at the top and licensed it with a [creative commons][]
license. 

### URIs ###

And finally a small toot of my own horn -- because I took the time and effort to generate [cool uri][]s when I used
blosxom, I was able to switch blogging apps without breaking any links (that I'm aware of).  I'm using a completely
different system, written in a different language, using a different storage mechanism for the data, and it's all
seamless to the end user -- that's the way URIs were meant to be.  If you have ugly URIs, do yourself and the web
community a favor -- fix them now, (but [don't break your old links][broken urls]).  (If you happen to notice any broken
or missing links on the new site, please comment below.)
