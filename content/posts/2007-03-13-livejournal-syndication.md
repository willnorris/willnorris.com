LiveJournal has a recurring problem in dealing with syndicated feeds that I can't quite figure out -- under certain
circumstances, it decides that all the items in a feed are new even though they have had absolutely no updates.  The net
effect of this is that for any users that added that syndication to their friends list, the last 10 posts jump to the
top of their friends page.  Since it only shows 20 items per page, this can knock any *actual* new posts from other
friends back several pages, which is incredibly annoying.  I don't know why it is doing this, and I apologize to the
half dozen or so people that subscribe that way.  I don't know how to fix it and since I can't guarantee how often it
may happen, I would recommend you not use LiveJournal for this purpose (basically, remove this feed from your friends
list).  I'd love to completely remove this feed from LiveJournal, but strangely they don't allow that even though I
initially added it (though I guess I could block their user-agent if they use one).

If you are in fact interested in tracking updates to this site, please use my [main feed URL][] directly.  I think most
of the people that subscribe through LJ are personal friends and so aren't too interested in the tech stuff, so you
could also just subscribe to my [personal posts][] if you prefer.  Again, sorry for all that, but LJ **really sucks** in
this regard.
