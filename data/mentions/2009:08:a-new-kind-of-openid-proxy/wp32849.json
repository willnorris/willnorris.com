As a privacy nerd I must assume the service is my enemy (this is why protocols like ToR and MIxmaster are set up to work even if you do not trust the nodes themselves).</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure exactly what usecase you're trying to solve.  Why do you want to use your own OP at all?  Why not have a string of anonymous OPs?  The easiest anonymous OP implementation is one where all assertions are true (ie, anyone can \"log in as\" any OpenID with the OP).</p>\n",
