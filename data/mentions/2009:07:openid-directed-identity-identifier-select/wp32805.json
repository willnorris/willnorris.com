That was never part of the delegation use case.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid correlation you need totally separate openIDs or better pairwise identifiers as Will has described.</p>\n\n<p>Delegation supports some measure of OP independence if you control your URI.   It also allows for a measure of OP redundancy/fault tolerance at RP's that properly support XRDS.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect delegation will become a smaller percentage of logins as the large OPs start taking more of the market.   I would be happy to be wrong about that.</p>\n\n<p>John B.</p>\n",
