I guess I never actually mentioned it here on my site, but [I'm getting married][wedding] in two weeks.  If you
remember, I originally [moved to California][] for Elisabeth a little over two years ago, and now we're finally getting
married.  We're both definitely excited about it, but at least for the next week and half we're just stressed out trying
to get everything ready.

Every marriage counseling book in the world would probably recommend otherwise, but I'm also taking a new job when we
get back from the honeymoon.  I resigned my position at USC early last week, and my last day will be next Friday April
25th, 2008.  It is a bit bittersweet, as I really wish I would have had the time to wrap up more of the unfinished
projects I'm leaving behind, but I trust that they are in good enough hands and will be well cared for.  If things go as
planned, I will continue on as part of the core Shibboleth development team, which I feel is very important.  There are
a few major additions to Shibboleth we've talked about adding, but simply haven't had the time.  The primary attraction
to the new job is quite simply the work I'll be doing and who I'll be doing it with -- I'll finally be able to really
dig in to some of the projects that haven't received the level of attention I would have liked to give.  Aside from
that, I don't think I'm ready to say too much else about the new job, only that it is in San Francisco and that we will
be moving up there as soon as the wedding is over and we find a place.
