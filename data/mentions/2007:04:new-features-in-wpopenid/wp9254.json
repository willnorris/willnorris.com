I suppose because of my theme, but I want to make sure it's not because of my openid-server.[/quote]\r\nwithout knowing what is actually wrong, I can't do much.  Either email me off-site or add a topic <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.org/support\">here</a> (and make sure to tag it \"openid\" so I'll see it).",
