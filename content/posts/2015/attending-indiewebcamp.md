I'm looking forward to <data class="p-rsvp" value="yes">attending</data> <a
href="https://kylewm.com/2015/12/indiewebcamp-sf-2015" rel="in-reply-to"
class="u-in-reply-to">IndieWebCamp SF 2015</a> this year. I've missed the last couple of events for
various reasons, and really want to get back into things. I'm thinking about maybe hacking on <a
href="https://camlistore.org/">Camlistore</a> a bit this year, perhaps doing some <a
href="https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/commits?author=willnorris">more work</a> on
documentation.
