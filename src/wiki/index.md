This is space for my personal notes.  Despite the URL, it's not really a wiki in the traditional
sense, as it's not intended to be collaborative and there is no front-end editor.  It's just a set
of pages like any other.

### Pages ###

<ul>
  {% for p in site.wiki %}
    <li><a href="{{ p.url }}">{{ p.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
