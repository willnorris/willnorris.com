    "html": "I'm using Wordpress 2.3, PHP 5.1.6, and the latest from wp-openid trunk (revision 20593).  I'm getting a fatal error when trying to activate the plugin. <code>Fatal error: Call to undefined method Log_error_log::error() in /var/www/vhosts/liferain.com/httpdocs/id/ShackDougall/wp-content/plugins/openid/interface.php on line 36</code>  In case it's helpful, here's a link to my server's <a href=\"http://liferain.com/id/ShackDougall/php-info/\">phpinfo</a>.  The fatal error is some kind of misconfiguration in logging, I guess, but if you look at line 36, it looks like the line that's failing is <code>if( !$this-&gt;logic-&gt;enabled ) { // Something broke, can't start UI</code>.  I'm not sure how to proceed.  Any thoughts?",
