That is when I first learned about the wonderful world of the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/why\">IndieWeb</a>. It took me a while to read through some of the concepts of the IndieWeb like webmentions, IndieAuth, microformats and all the other standards, but the more I found out about it the more I wanted to play around with it. And what better place to try out new technology than on a personal website?</p>\n<h2>The IndieWeb</h2>\n<p>I will start with a brief introduction for the uninitiated. If you have already heard about the IndieWeb, feel free to skip to the next section.</p>\n<p>The IndieWeb is a collection of standards, intending to make the web social, without the user giving up ownership of their data. While on social media platforms (or as called in IndieWeb terms: silos) you can easily communicate with others, you are always subject to the whims of those platforms.</p>\n<p>The IndieWeb wants to solve this by defining standards that, once implemented in a website, allow it to communicate with other websites that are also part of the IndieWeb.</p>\n<p>The most important concept of the IndieWeb is, you have control over your data. All of your shared data lives on a domain you control.</p>\n<p>Some of the standards in the IndieWeb include:</p>\n<ul><li>Microformats2: a way to add structured data to the HTML source code of a website so machines can interpret the data.</li>\n<li>Webmentions: a simple communication protocol between websites. It can be used to show comments, likes, bookmarks and more on one website, while the data stays on another website.</li>\n<li>IndieAuth, an OAuth2-based way to log in using only your domain name.</li>\n</ul><h2>The implementation on my website</h2>\n<p>As explained in my earlier post <a href=\"https://tiim.ch/blog/2022-07-12-first-go-project-commenting-api\">First Go Project: A Jam-stack Commenting API</a>, my website is a statically built SvelteKit app hosted on GitHub Pages. This means the most important part of the IndieWeb is already implemented: I own this domain and post my content here.</p>\n<h3>Making the website machine-readable with Microformats</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the microformats2 standard allows websites to encode data about the page in a machine-readable format. This is accomplished by annotating HTML elements with some predefined class names. For example, the microformat for a blog post, note and other content is called <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry\">h-entry</a>. By adding the <code>h-entry</code> class to a div, its content is marked as belonging to that post. Children of this div can in turn have other microformat elements such as <code>p-name</code>, <code>p-author</code> or <code>dt-published</code>.</p>\n<p>While these CSS classes make the data machine-interpretable, the same data is still available to the user. There is no duplication like for example the meta tags in OpenGraph.</p>\n<p>Since my page is a custom SvelteKit app, it was easy enough to add the CSS classes to the right places. I even took the opportunity to add some more information to the pages, like the author card you see if you scroll to the bottom of this post.</p>\n<h3>Accepting comments and other interactions via Webmentions</h3>\n<p>The standard I wanted to play around with the most are webmentions.

And what better place to try out new technology than on a personal website?\nThe IndieWeb\nI will start with a brief introduction for the uninitiated. If you have already heard about the IndieWeb, feel free to skip to the next section.\nThe IndieWeb is a collection of standards, intending to make the web social, without the user giving up ownership of their data. While on social media platforms (or as called in IndieWeb terms: silos) you can easily communicate with others, you are always subject to the whims of those platforms.\nThe IndieWeb wants to solve this by defining standards that, once implemented in a website, allow it to communicate with other websites that are also part of the IndieWeb.\nThe most important concept of the IndieWeb is, you have control over your data. All of your shared data lives on a domain you control.\nSome of the standards in the IndieWeb include:\nMicroformats2: a way to add structured data to the HTML source code of a website so machines can interpret the data.\nWebmentions: a simple communication protocol between websites. It can be used to show comments, likes, bookmarks and more on one website, while the data stays on another website.\nIndieAuth, an OAuth2-based way to log in using only your domain name.\nThe implementation on my website\nAs explained in my earlier post First Go Project: A Jam-stack Commenting API, my website is a statically built SvelteKit app hosted on GitHub Pages.
