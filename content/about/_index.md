Hi, I'm <a href="https://willnorris.com/" class="p-name u-url fn url">Will Norris</a>. I'm a
follower of Jesus, a husband to [Elisabeth][], a father to [Gabriel][] and [Judah][], a citizen of
the [indie web][], and the <span class="p-role role">Open Source Lead</span> at <span class="p-org
org">Twitter</span>.
</div>

Prior to Twitter I was at Google [for 10 years][], with most of that time spent in their [Open
Source Programs Office][] leading the engineering and license compliance groups.  I had previously
helped design and build the [Google+ API][], having spent much of my career working on developing
tools and technologies for the social web like [OpenID][], [OAuth][], [XRD][], and [Activity
Streams][].  I also spent a number of years in the enterprise identity management space working on
[Shibboleth][] and LDAP directories at [USC][].

Almost all of my personal projects these days are [indie web][] related, mostly [written in go][].
I'm also a huge fan of [WordPress][] and their mission to democratize publishing.  Even though I no
longer use WordPress for this site, I still manage other WordPress-powered site, and continue to
maintain a number of [plugins][] and occasionally contribute to WordPress core and WordPress for
Android.

### Colophon ###

[This site][] is powered by [Hugo][], hosted on [Google Cloud Platform][] and all of my domains are
registered with [Google Domains][] (which I [highly recommend][]).  [Short URLs][] for my content are
resolved using a small server I wrote called [gum][].  Most images are proxied through my
[imageproxy][] server to handle simple things like dynamic resizing.
