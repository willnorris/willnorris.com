    "html": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThx for fixing the $_POST issue :) I developed Simple OpenID last year and also did the replay dance with code found in wp-comments-post.php :p It's great to see you found a workaround for the $_GET block. \r\n\r\nI tested revision 338 against the anti spam plugin WP Mollom. I did have issues with $_POST with version 2.1.9 of WP OpenID but the development version works like a charm. \r\n\r\nThanks for fixing this :)\r\n\r\nWith regards.",
