title: Ideas for Android Wear
---

I got an Android Wear device this past year, and have discovered that there really is a certain
class of apps that work well for the form factor.  Things that don't need a lot of input, don't need
to display a whole lot of output, things that are particularly timely, etc.  This is a running list
of apps that I think would work well on Android Wear and that I'd like to see.

Tabata Timer
: There are a handful of tabata timers for Android and the one I sometimes use, [Tabata HIIT
Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xquadro.tabataTimer), doesn't support
Android Wear as far as I know.  Depending on what exercise you're doing, glancing at your wrist to
see the clock may be more or less difficult, so this wouldn't work for everything.  Similarly, the
watch could vibrate to indicate the start or stop of an interval (at least my watch doesn't have a
speaker), but if the vibration is too subtle it may go unnoticed.

Injection Reminder
: I've still not found a daily injection reminder app that I really like, and have long since
thought about building one.  As for the Android Wear component, it should prompt me when it's time
for an injection, visually indicate which injection site should be used next, and allow a simple
"done" action which records the time.  Everything gets recorded in the app on the phone, but the
whole thing can probably be driven through the watch.
