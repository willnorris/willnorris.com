When I tried logging in, it gave me the following error:\r\n\r\nWordPress database error: [Unknown column 'server_url' in 'field list']\r\nREPLACE INTO wp_openid_settings (server_url, timestamp, salt) VALUES (blah, blah, blah)\r\n\r\nI was going to try and add the column myself, but I figured I'd let you know about it and just wait for the gold version.",
