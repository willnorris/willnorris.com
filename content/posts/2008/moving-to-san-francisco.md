Here's an update for family and friends of what we've been up to and what's next...

As I've [previously][] [mentioned][], I started a new job at Vidoop a month or so ago which will have Elisabeth and I
moving to San Francisco.  We were both up there a couple of weeks ago and were able to find an absolutely perfect
apartment.  It took a little bit to convince the landlord that we really were planning to be in San Francisco for the
long term, but it was well worth the extra trouble.  The place we found is right in the heart of SOMA, about four
buildings down from [Chris][] who I'll be working with at Vidoop.  It's a beautiful three story loft, hardwood floors
throughout, 2 bedroom, 2 and half bath, washer and dryer in the unit, parking space included (which would otherwise cost
upwards of $300 a month), 20 foot ceiling in the living room with windows all the way to the top (lots of natural
light)... all in all about 1500 square feet.  Like I said, it's really perfect for us.  The one major downside is that
the kitchen is rather small, especially compared to what Elisabeth has been used to all her life, but we'll manage.

We've also just about finished our post-wedding shopping for furniture and kitchen stuff to outfit our new home.  We did
our "registry completion" at Linens 'N Things, where they let you buy everything left on your registry at 20% off.  So
we bought everything they had (including Elisabeth's [KitchenAid Mixer][] which will be the centerpiece of our kitchen)
and a few additional things we saw.  Somehow I think we got 20% off the things that *weren't* on our registry as well,
but oh well.  We also made an "impulse buy" at World Market when we saw that we could get their entire [Tao
Collection][] of furniture for 60% off.  We bought every piece they had with the exception of one table that we didn't
really know where to put, so we're now good on furniture for the entire living room and office.  We still need a bedroom
suite, but that's just gonna have to wait for the time being.  We will be setting up the second bedroom as a guest room,
so once we get settled I fully expect people to come over and visit. :-)

Pretty much everything is packed up and ready to move here.  The moving company comes to load everything up on Monday,
July 7th and plans to deliver it to the new place sometime between the 9th and the 14th.  It depends on what other loads
they can fit onto the same truck, but we should have a more definite delivery date in a few days.  In the meantime I'm
working wherever I can find high speed internet access, and we're saying our goodbyes to local family and friends.  Two
weeks from now we'll be in San Francisco setting up the new place.  (Anyone in SOMA want to come and help assemble a LOT
of furniture?)
