    "html": "<p>Great article Will. In the early days of OpenID I preached long and hard about the reassignable identifier problem (which the OpenID community generally calls the recyclable identifier problem). But folks were not too worried about it -- the general attitude was, \"We'll solve it when we get there.\"</p>\n\n<p>As your article describes, if you wait until you get there, it's too late ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Here's hoping the next generation of OpenID (the rumored OpenID v.next) gets non-recyclable identifier right.</p>\n\n<p>=Drummond</p>\n",
