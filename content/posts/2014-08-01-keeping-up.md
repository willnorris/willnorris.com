I've spent this week trying to keep up with all that's been happening in the [Indie Web][] the last few months.
Inspired by Tantek's [additions this week][], I've now implemented [fragmentions][] ([try it out][]), with similar
styling to what Tantek is using.  I spent my birthday writing a go webmention library and client, and this post is my
first attempt at POSSEing using [brid.gy][].  Assuming this works, my next step will be documenting my workflow and
publishing some code.
