So I've made a few updates to my port of [wpopenid][], and feel like this is coming along rather nicely.  The full list
of changes can be found on my [project page][], along with download links, subversion URLs, etc.  Note that as of this
writing, the latest version is r13, which is actually lower than the previous release (r92wn1).  This merely reflects
that I'm basing it off the revision numbers in my own repository versus the official one at sourceforge.  Also note that
there is no longer a diff provided, since I've made the subversion repository public.
