Now this is a neat little feature in iTunes I didn't know about -- it will stop downloading new podcast episodes if you
don't listen to the ones you already have.

<img src="itunes-podcasts.jpg" alt="iTunes notification window which reads, 'iTunes has stopped updating this podcast
because you have not listened to any episodes recently.  Would you like to resume updating this podcast?'" />
