## Personal

After 13 years living in and around Half Moon Bay, CA, we moved to Temecula, CA this past summer (2023).
Elisabeth's family lives in the area, and there were just a lot of reasons right now to move.
Quite honestly, we're still adjusting to new schools, new community, new everything.
While there are certainly some aspects that are great, overall it's been a tough transition.

I haven't been reading as much as I would like.
Still mostly science fiction when I do.
I recently finished _A Memory Called Empire_, and am now on the second book of the series,
[A Desolation Called Peace](https://www.arkadymartine.net/books/adcp).

## Professional

I've been working as a software engineer at Tailscale since May 2022.
Right now, I'm working on the Tailscale [web client],
which is primarily used on Synology and similar NAS devices as well as Home Assistant.
