    "html": "<p>Great story, Will. That reminds me of a time that I received a message on Twitter because I track the name of my home town (i.e, send \"track Omaha\" to Twitter, and you'll get all public tweets containing that word.). It mentioned the recent ice storm we had in our area. The author said that he stayed in a Red Cross shelter at a local church. I recognized the church as the one where my son attends pre-school 2 days a week. I checked the church's web site and found the IT guy's contact information. We have now corresponded a couple of times, and he was touched to read about someone positively effected by his employer, the church.</p>\n\n<p>All this technology tends to make our lives less personal. Sometimes it takes a little work to make sure we remain human.</p>\n\n<p>--df</p>\n",
