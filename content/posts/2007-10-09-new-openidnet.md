Via [Mark Jaquith][] (via [Simon Willison][]), it looks like [OpenID.net][] has gone through a pretty major redesign.
One exciting note for me is that they appear to be using my [OpenID plugin][] for Wordpress.  [David][] had talked to me
some time ago about using it, but I hadn't heard recently that they planned to.  For the curious, they are not running
any stable release (as of this writing) but rather the latest code from subversion.  It's pretty stable at this point,
as I am also running that on this site, but I'll still try and make an official release pretty soon now.
