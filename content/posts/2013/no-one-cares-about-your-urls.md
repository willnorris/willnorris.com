In response to [Posterous shutting down][], Tantek [made the comparison][tantek-comparison] to Pownce having been
acquired and subsequently shuttered by Six Apart back in 2008.  There's actually something very interesting about the
blog post announcing [Pownce shutting down][].  At the end of the post, Pownce co-founder and lead engineer Leah Culver
notes,

> As for the Pownce team, we’ll continue posting on Vox. You can find me at [leahculver.vox.com][] ...

So how's that working out?  Well, Vox (Six Apart's blogging service) was shutdown in 2010, so [leahculver.vox.com][] now
redirects to [leahculver.typepad.com/vox][], which oddly has an HTTP authentication prompt.  If we just try
[leahculver.typepad.com][], that still exists but hasn't been updated since January 2012.  Want to guess where she does
actively blog?  Yeah, that's right, on [leahculver.com][].

The *only* way for you to ensure the integrity and longevity of your content is for you to take ownership of how it is
accessed.  Do yourself a favor and go buy a domain that you use for publishing your content.
