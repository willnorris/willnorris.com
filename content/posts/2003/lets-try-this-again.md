so i got fed up with [movabletype][], and decided to switch over to [blosxom][].  It's a much cleaner and much more
flexible system... so far i'm liking it a lot.  So maybe this means I'll get around to writing in here once or twice a
week like I had hoped at one time... we'll see.  Not much time to get into stuff right now, seeing as how it is almost
six in the morning - will have to do some updating when I get to work.
