    "html": "<p>@Alexandre: yes, there is an <a href=\"http://dev.wp-plugins.org/ticket/701\">open ticket</a> for adding FOAF, among other protocols.  I can't guarantee when I'll get it added, there are method stubs in the plugin where this planned to go and patches are always welcome.  I spent too much time on wp-openid to get 2.0 released, so now I'm spending a little time on other projects (and my day-job) :).</p>\n",
