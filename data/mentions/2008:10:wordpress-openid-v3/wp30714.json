I've had a query up for 2 weeks with no response (not the only one with the same error).\r\n\r\nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/257773?replies=2\r\n\r\nHere's the content of my request:\r\n\r\nRunning OpenID 3.2.2 on WP 2.7.1.\r\n\r\nEvery time I try to add a new OpenID I get the message \"OpenIDloginfailed:Invalidopenid.modeNomodeset\".\r\n\r\nI'm logged into the MyOpenID site already and have used the id elsewhere without issues, so the id is valid and already logged in.\r\n\r\nHelp?",
