If you've got WPMU setup to use sub-domains for user blogs (like wordpress.com does), then this will likely break the ability to go between hosted blogs and still be logged in.  If however you are using sub-directories, it should work fine.  (Keep in mind, I've not actually tested this, but it seems reasonable).",
