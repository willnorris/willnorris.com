Perhaps this would make for a useful feature?</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, the OpenID login and profile implementations work great! No bugs, as far as I can tell. Of course, I've made some changes to the source code in order to integrate it with my blog's design.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the great work.</p>\n",
