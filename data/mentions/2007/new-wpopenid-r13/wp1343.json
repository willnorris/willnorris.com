Any suggestions?</blockquote>\r\nHmm, I know that it respects delegation in most cases since that is what I use here.  What is the OpenID it's not honoring? The one you just logged in with here (http://www.ende-der-vernunft.org/MyID.php)?  Hmm, doesn't look like you have it activated right now, so I can't test it to see if it honors my delegated ID.",
