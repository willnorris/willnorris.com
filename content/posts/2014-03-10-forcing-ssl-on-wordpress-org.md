So it seems that [wordpress.org now serves traffic over SSL](http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-org-now-delivered-ssl/),
and will soon be switching to SSL only.  In the comments on the above article, [Andrew Nacin](http://nacin.com/) said:

> Yeah, all of WordPress.org will be 100% forced SSL soon.

For WordPress, I suspect that this was largely a pragmatic decision to take advantage of SPDY, but I'll take it!
Whatever gets more of the web encrypted.
