If I end up implementing the BuddyPress profile endpoints, I'll see if I can make the system abstract enough so that arbitrary system urls can server as endpoints, and then maybe we can get standalone/MU WordPress profiles as endpoints as well.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you have any thoughts on this.</p>\n\n<p>John</p>\n",
