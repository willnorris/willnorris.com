    "html": "This is a simple case of \"Civil Rights\" and equality. \r\n\r\nBeliefs are one thing - and they're great to have. I'm sure if the government listened to Everyone's beliefs all the time we'd be in a different place. \r\n\r\nLincoln had his idea of civil rights, while the south had their beliefs. Martin Luther King, he had his ideas as well, while the paler Americans had their beliefs. \r\n\r\nGay marriage ranks up there with equality amongst races, and sexes alike. Women can vote, slavery's been forgotten, now -let's let these people marry each other already and get on with it. \r\n\r\nFunny. If Will Norris was gay, I'm pretty sure his outlook would be different, which in and of itself makes this proposition a subjective matter of perspective, and thus - immoral.",
