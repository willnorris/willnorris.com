Google <a href=\"http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/10/moving-another-step-closer-to-single.html\">will be adding support</a> for directed identity shortly, so that users just have to type \"gmail.com\" to login.  Microsoft's OpenID provider won't be production <a href=\"http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/10/27/421.aspx\">until 2009</a>, so I'm not too worried about it.",
