title: Comparison of Support among OpenID Providers
---
**Gone as of December 2013**

This page used to display a table comparing the OpenID protocol support by some of the more popular OpenID providers.
The protocols this page tested for are all but dead at this point, and I haven't maintained the list for several years
now, so I've taken it down.  You can find old cached versions in the [Internet
Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://willnorris.com/openid-support).

If you are interested in the future of OpenID, see [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect).
