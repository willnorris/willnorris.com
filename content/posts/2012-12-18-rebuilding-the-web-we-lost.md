Anil Dash follows up his essay from last week with [Rebuilding the Web We Lost][]:

> But the most important question we can ask is: How do we rebuild the positive aspects of the web we lost? There are a
> few starting points, building on conversations we've been having for years. Let's look at the responsibilities we must
> accept if we're going to return the web to the values that a generation of creators cared about.

Color me inspired and ready to jump backing to putting into practice the principles I've been professing for so many
years.  It's time to stop talking and (re)start doing.
