    "html": "<p>Interesting idea using a proxy to further protect the user's identity. However, wouldn't the use of a proxy just make it more computationally difficult to obtain owner of the directly identity generated by the proxy? With no proxy, as you've mentioned previously, it is possible to figure out the owner of the directed identity by having access to the openID provider (subpoena the OIDP and obtain the secret salt). With a proxy, couldnt the judge still subpoena the proxy AND the list of OIDPs associated with the it and try all proxy-OIDP combinations?</p>\n",
