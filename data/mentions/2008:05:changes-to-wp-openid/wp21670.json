Sorry for the ignorance, I thought my comments would help out with development, I had no idea that they were just full of ignorance.

My only remark was that I wanted to know the previous version that worked, but now it seems like you have solved my problem (I thought that HEAD didn\\'t work because of Work in Progress).",
