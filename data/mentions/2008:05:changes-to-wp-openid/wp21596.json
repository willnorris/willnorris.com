    "html": "Revision 315 is broken for me. Many users have told me that it no longer authenticates them with OpenID and redirects them to my blog's front page with a very long URL. Please try for yourself by commenting here: http://www.blaenkdenum.com/new-star-wars-clone-wars-trailer . I'm not sure if this is a work in progress bug or something, being that it's the latest revision, but I don't remember the revision I was using before that so I can't revert to a working version. Thanks for any help you can give!",
