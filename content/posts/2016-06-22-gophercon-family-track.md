So I just got an email about [GopherCon][]'s Significant Other and Family Track:

> Summer is a great time of year to travel with our loved ones. We're excited to announce that
> SO/Family Track tickets are now available for significant others and kids who'll be in Denver July
> 11-13th! Please register each person regardless of age so we'll know how many people to expect.
>
> This will be a great way to meet new people and explore the area while attendees take part in the
> third annual Gophercon. We've got activities planned Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, plus a
> rendezvous room at the convention center for afternoon chill time. We'll take a tour of the Denver
> Art Museum and have free time for exploring the city on Monday, then make an excursion to the
> gorgeous country outside of Denver on Tuesday. Wednesday we'll have a chance to tinker during Hack
> Day. We'll also have family-friendly meetups in the evenings.

This is amazingly cool!  I don't think I've ever seen a conference that specifically planned
something like this for families.
