    "html": "I came here looking to see if the latest Wordpress (2.7) release was compatible with the openid plugin -- and stumbled across this discussion.\r\n\r\nIt's unusual finding a good, civil discussion about this issue. It was incredibly encouraging reading this.\r\n\r\nWhen people have beliefs of right and wrong that are founded in morality, rather than ethics, it's generally a very nasty conversation, since morality doesn't always sit on very solidly on rational foundations.\r\n\r\nBut Will, you somehow moved beyond this inherent bias. It's a testament to both your intelligence and to your empathy. And without empathy, intelligence alone is dangerous.\r\n\r\nYou're a rare bird. I am impressed, and inspired, that others might one day allow themselves to see more broadly.\r\n\r\nThough it's probably a silly thing to say, since you are who you are, thank you for being so thoughtful and concerned enough to explore what the right thing actually might be. And further than that, to take that step into standing up for it.",
