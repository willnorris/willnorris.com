    "html": "<p>Tom: why don't they work? Because email addresses are not OpenIDs.  Google defined their own <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/apps/sso/openid_reference_implementation.html\">custom discovery protocol</a> for Google Apps.  <a href=\"http://rpxnow.com/\">RPX</a>, which the demo site you linked to is using, implements Google's discovery protocol so it works on any RPX sites.  Because this is not a standard discovery protocol, but is instead a vendor-specific option, I will not be adding support for it to the OpenID WordPress plugin.  An additional plugin should probably be able to do so however without too much trouble... I'll have to double check if the appropriate hooks are present, and add them if not.</p>\n",
