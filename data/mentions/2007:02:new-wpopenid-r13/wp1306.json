I have installed wpopenid+ on my blog, thanks for new feature and bug correction.</p>\n\n<p>I have changed an element in plugin, if name, mail and website field have data, i use this and not sreg data (i have added url). It is for authorize user to override information for current comment.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have include this in plugin options but if you can add an option to enable this feature it is a good idea. I can send a patch to you if you want.</p>\n",
