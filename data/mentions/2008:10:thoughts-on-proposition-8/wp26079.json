    "html": "hi will.  not that you have to disclose your vote, but i am curious how all of this shook out for you.  i've had several encounters lately with christian friends who have had their own (pardon the expression) \"come to jesus\" moments lately and are voting for obama.  i know a vote for obama does not equal a vote against prop 8, but it's been interesting to have rational, thought-provoking discussions with someone at the other end of the spectrum from me without it devolving into invectives and ugliness.\r\n\r\nalso, just curious is you saw larry lessig's video re. prop 8:\r\nhttp://blip.tv/file/1404208\r\n\r\nan interesting argument about what exactly strengthens or protects marriage...\r\n\r\nhope that if you didn't vote early, you don't have to wait in line too long tomorrow.  take care.",
