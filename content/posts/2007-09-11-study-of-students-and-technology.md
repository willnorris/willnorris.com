The Educause Center for Applied Research (ECAR) published today <cite>[The ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and
Information Technology, 2007][study]</cite>.

> This 2007 ECAR research study is a longitudinal extension of the 2004, 2005, and 2006 ECAR studies of students and
> information technology. The study, which reports noticeable changes from previous years, is based on quantitative data
> from a spring 2007 survey and interviews with 27,846 freshman, senior, and community college students at 103 higher
> education institutions. It focuses on what kinds of information technologies these students use, own, and experience;
> their technology behaviors, preferences, and skills; how IT impacts their experiences in their courses; and their
> perceptions of the role of IT in the academic experience.

I'd highly recommend this to any technology firm targeting the college demographic.
