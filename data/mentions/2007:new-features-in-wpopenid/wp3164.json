    "html": "[quote comment=\"2976\"]Hi\r\nI have installed the plugin, but I have got an error. As soon as I tried to activate it, I got \"Fatal error: Call to undefined function: set_include_path() in /home/sites/site4/users/duke-wie/web/blog/wp-content/plugins/wpopenid/openid-registration.php on line 919\"\r\n\r\nLooking at the blog, it had the OpenID logo by the login area, but when I tried to enter one, it crashed with the same error.\r\n\r\nI've got WordPress 2.0.10. I've fogotten what the php version is, but I know that it's the one that's not quite enough to allow us to use WP 2.1 (? php v 3???)[/quote]\r\nWP 2.0 and 2.1 have the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Hosting_WordPress#Server_requirements\">same requirement</a> on PHP version, some documentation says 4.1, other places say it's 4.2.  Either way, the error your getting is for <a href=\"http://us2.php.net/set_include_path\">a function</a> that was created in 4.3.  I didn't realize the plugin had a higher dependency than WP itself, so I'll look into that when I can.\r\n\r\n<b>update:</b> I've <a href=\"http://dev.wp-plugins.org/ticket/649\">filed a ticket</a> so you can track the progress of this item if you'd like.",
