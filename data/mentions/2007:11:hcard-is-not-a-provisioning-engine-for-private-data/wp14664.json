    "html": "<p>agreed, it is much more likely that truly different personas would be represented by different OpenID URLs, but many providers support this concept today as I described it.</p>\n\n<p>The much more provocative use case is private data, and I really don't think shoe-horning hCard is the most appropriate or secure way of handling that.  Not only because of the technical question of how it would be done, but also because I am much more comfortable knowing that it can only occur <em>at the time I login</em>, as is the case with SREG/AX (excepting that AX can perform subsequent updates of the data).</p>\n",
