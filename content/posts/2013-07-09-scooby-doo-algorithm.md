Today I learned, while reading about the new `<main>` element [recently added][] to HTML5, that the [Scooby Doo
Algorithm][] is a thing:

>  ... you always know that the person behind the ghost mask will be the sinister janitor of the disused theme park,
>  simply because he’s the only person in the episode who isn’t Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, or Scooby.
