<a href="http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4QyAxk/" class="in-reply-to">Barnaby</a>, to your last point, GitHub actually does
do redirects when repositories get moved or renamed. You can read the announcement <a
href="https://github.com/blog/1508-repository-redirects-are-here">here</a>. I doubt they do it for historical renames
though; only new ones going forward.
