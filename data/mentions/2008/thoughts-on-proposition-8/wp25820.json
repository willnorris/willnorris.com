    "html": "We have a namespace collision with \"marriage,\" and while we figure out how that collision relates to government, which way should we lean? Should we err on the side of closed and then open up new avenues, or should we keep the laws open, and then gradually narrow down applications?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty I see with your argument is that same-sex marriage is the incumbent here, so I'd argue that if Prop 8 IS passed then the \"war will be won.\" I don't have sources available, but I understand Yes on Prop 8 is better funded and better organized, being backed by religious organizations. These organizations won't give up the fight if Prop 8 does not pass. Indeed, they may instead move for the ideal situation you propose. Same-sex marriage does not have as strong a lobby.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I can't in good conscience vote for something that *may*, depending on how overzealous people may apply law, infringe on the rights of my fellow citizens. When it comes to imperfect propositions, I'm erring on the side of open.",
