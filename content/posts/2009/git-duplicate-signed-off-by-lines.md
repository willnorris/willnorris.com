I've been playing around with [git][] a lot as an alternative to subversion and am really loving it.  However, I'm
getting an error every time I try to commit:

    Duplicate Signed-off-by lines.

I can see where this is being thrown inside `.git/hooks/commit-msg`, but it wasn't immediately obvious what the problem
was.  I did a quick google search and found that others have had the same problem, but at least some members of the git
community have been [less than helpful][].  I did figure out the problem, and figured I'd share it here for others.

The commit-msg script is written using bash style [shell expansions][],

    foo = $(bar)

while the [shebang][] at the top of the file is set to `/bin/sh`.  On many systems, this is not a bash shell.  The
solution is to simply modify the shebang to wherever bash is on your system (probably `/usr/bin/bash` or similar).
