I just finally saw Lloyd's post about the [WordCamp SF Genius Bar][], and I felt a bit inspired.  One of the problems
that has plagued wp-openid for a while is the rather random problems people tend to have in getting the plugin to work.
It often has to do with some setting in their hosting environment or the OpenID provider they're attempting to use.  So
if anyone is having a problem like this and you're planning to attend [WordCamp SF 2008][], come and find me and show me
what you've got.  I'll be speaking during the camp about OAuth at some point, and will do my best to make myself
available the rest of the time.
