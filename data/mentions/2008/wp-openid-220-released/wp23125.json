    "html": "Will,\r\nThanks for the plugin. This is a really important bit of infrastructure for wordpress to be receiving.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I've noticed that I am receiving the following error:\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Too many values for format string:  =&gt; 1218639686 in [my home dir]/public_html/wp-content/plugins/openid/store.php on line 441\r\n\r\nThat comes from the interpolate function. The error arose when I clicked on the \"Manage\" tab on the dashboard, and it resulted in a 404.\r\n\r\nI'm using WP2.6. Please mail me if you want more information. Thanks!",
