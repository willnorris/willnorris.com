    "html": "Hi. I am glad that you have made this plugin - it's just great that every site doesn't need a new sign up necessarily.. Anyway.. There seems to be a small problem with your plugin..\r\n\r\nI was using a plugin that enables a login widget in my sidebar (one that tells that it supports openid if openid plugin is installed) - and I noticed that it didn't work very nicely - so how to continue from here? I decided to create my own plugin and make it a fancy one :)\r\n\r\nUntil I ran into problems which where similar to problems I encountered with pre-done plugin I mentioned in the beginning.. Finally I was able to isolate this problem to your openid-plugin as a cause..\r\n\r\nWP 2.7.1 comes with jquery 1.3 branch and with jquery UI 1.7 branch - your plugin uses jquery XPATH plugin to bring back XPATH compatibility that was removed from jquery in 1.3 - unfortunately this doesn't seem to work very well as I am now unable to use jquery UI's tabs part at all.\r\n\r\nSafari reports this:\r\nTypeError: Result of expression 'A.cookie' [undefined] is not a function.\r\n\r\nIf I remove your plugin or remove file jquery.xpath.min.js (so it cannot be loaded) - everything seems to go just fine - although I don't know how well your plugin performs without it..\r\n\r\nWould there be a possibility that you could get your xpath plugin fixed or use functions that exist in jquery? I checked some files and noticed that under folder Yadis there are lot of occurances about xpath so this isn't propably anything like 5 minutes of coding, but...",
